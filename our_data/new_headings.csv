3,33,"@abstr_image  This feature is highly experimental. It's possible to open a video window from the ""View"" menu. This window simulates the output of a MOS @abstr_number CRT Controller located at address $ @abstr_number and $ @abstr_number.  By default, the @abstr_number x @abstr_number character display uses video memory located at base address $ @abstr_number. This means that the memory from address $ @abstr_number ( @abstr_number decimal) to $ @abstr_number E @abstr_number ( @abstr_number decimal) is directly mapped to video.    * Address Register (at address $ @abstr_number)   * R @abstr_number : Horizontal Displayed Columns   * R @abstr_number : Vertical Displayed Rows   * R @abstr_number : Scan Lines per Row   * R @abstr_number : Cursor Start Scan Line and Cursor Control Mode   * R @abstr_number : Cursor End Scan Line   * R @abstr_number : Display Start Address (High Byte)   * R @abstr_number : Display Start Address (Low Byte)   * R @abstr_number : Cursor Position (High Byte)   * R @abstr_number : Cursor Position (Low Byte)    Although the simulation is pretty good, there are a few key differences between the simulated @abstr_number and a real @abstr_number :    * The simulated @abstr_number supports only the straight binary addressing mode of the real @abstr_number , and not the Row/Column addressing mode.    * The simulated @abstr_number has full @abstr_number bit addressing, where the real @abstr_number has only a @abstr_number -bit address bus.    * The simulation is done at a whole-frame level, meaning that lots of @abstr_number programming tricks that were achieved by updating the frame address during vertical and horizontal sync times are not achievable.

"
3,37,"The simulator requires a ROM image loaded into memory to work properly. Without a ROM in memory, the simulator will not be able to reset, since the reset vector for the @abstr_number is located in the ROM address space.  By default, any file named rom.bin that exists in the same directory where Symon is launched will be loaded as a ROM image. ROM images can also be swapped out at run-time with the ""Load ROM Image..."" in the File menu.  The ""samples"" directory contains a ROM image for the Symon architecture named 'ehbasic.rom', containing Lee Davison's Enhanced @abstr_number BASIC. This serves as a good starting point for exploration.  _Note_ : Presently, EhBASIC only works with the Symon machine architecture, not with MULTICOMP.  "

4,47,"In the real-world, different entities (people, animals, cars, you name it) are related in various ways. Within a single entity or group, there exist systems of classification. For example, the ""dogs"" entity or category includes pugs, corgis, labs, etc. All of these breeds share common features because they are all dogs. But they all have certain unique traits as well.  Another example: you are writing a web application in which users are either admins, instructors or students. All of these entities are ""users"" and have common features, but they all have some unique traits as well.  How can our code reflect that fact that these different categories of things all share some, or even many, characteristics but all have some unique attributes as well? Well, we could write separate admin, instructor and student class that each contain repetitious code to lend each of these classes shared attributes and behaviors. We know, however, that repetitious code is always something to be avoided. Not only is it time consuming but, what happens when we need to make a change to this shared behavior? We'd have to code the same change in three places.  Instead, we can use inheritance. The use of inheritance allows us to create a family of classes with shared behavior, while still differentiating those classes. With inheritance, we could _inherit_ the admin, instructor and student classes from a user class. Then, any changes made to the user class would apply to the other class.  While you may not write your own classes that use inheritance very frequently, you will encounter it frequently as a Ruby on Rails web developer. Once we introduce the use of databases and the challenge of connecting our programs to our database, you'll encounter inheritance in nearly every program you write for the web. More on that (much) later.  "
4,48,"In Ruby, classes can inherit from one another. This means that they adopt all of the attributes and behaviors (i.e. all of the methods) of the parent, also called the super class. In this exercise, we'll be building our own chain of inheritance.  "
4,49,"In this domain model, we have class Vehicle that will act as the parent, or super, class. We will create child classes, also known as subclasses for different types of Vehicles, such as car.  "
4,50,"Open up lib/super_vehicle.rb. We're going to define some methods in this parent class so that our subclasses, when we make them, will have access to them.  @abstr_code_section  Instances of Vehicle initialize with a wheel size and number. We also have #go and #fill_up_tank instance methods that describe some common vehicle behavior.  Go ahead and run the test suite and you'll see that you are passing all of the tests for the Vehicle class but none of the tests for the Car class.  "
4,51,"Open up lib/sub_car.rb. Notice that we are requiring lib/super_vehicle.rb. That is because our Car class will need access to the Vehicle class and will therefore need access to the file that contains that class.  Go ahead and define the class in the following way:  @abstr_code_section  We use the < to inherit the Car class from Vehicle. Notice that there are _no methods defined in theCar class_.  Run the test suite again and you'll see that you are passing a number of tests for the Car class.  Wow! We didn't write _anything_ in our Car class but instances of Car class _inherit_ all of the Vehicle methods and therefore have access to them. We're still failing the #go test however. Looks like the test is expecting the #go method on an individual car to return the phrase: ""VRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!"". This is different than the return value of the #go method that we inherited from the Vehicle class.  Let's overwrite the inherited go method with one specific to Car.  "
4,52,"In lib/sub_car.rb, write the following method:  @abstr_code_section  Now, run the tests again and you should be passing all of them.  "
4,53,"How does our above example work? Well, when your program is being executed, at the point at which the #go method is invoked, the compiler will first look in the class to which the instance of car that we are calling the method on belongs. If it finds a #go method there, it will execute _that method_. If it doesn't find such a method there, it will move on to look in the parent class that this class inherits from.  @abstr_hyperlink  View @abstr_hyperlink on Learn.co and start learning to code for free.

Prerender is perfect for AngularJS SEO, BackboneJS SEO, EmberJS SEO, and any other javascript framework.  Behind the scenes, Prerender is a node server from @abstr_hyperlink that uses phantomjs to create static HTML out of a javascript page. We host this as a service at @abstr_hyperlink but we also open sourced it because we believe basic SEO is a right, not a privilege!  It should be used in conjunction with these middleware libraries to serve the prerendered HTML to crawlers for SEO. Get started in two lines of code using @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink .  Prerender adheres to google's _escaped_fragment_ proposal, which we recommend you use. It's easy: - Just add  to the  of all of your pages - If you use hash urls (#), change them to the hash-bang (#!) - That's it! Perfect SEO on javascript pages.  Prerender includes lots of plugins, for example using Amazon S @abstr_number to cache your prerendered HTML. Prerender also starts multiple phantomjs processes to maximize throughput.  "

5,80,"We remove script tags because we don't want any framework specific routing/rendering to happen on the rendered HTML once it's executed by the crawler. The crawlers may not execute javascript, but we'd rather be safe than have something get screwed up.

6,93,"By providing a custom LayoutManager to RecyclerView, VirtualLayout is able to layout child views with different style at single view elegantly. The custom LayoutManager manages a serial of layoutHelpers where each one implements the specific layout logic for a certain position range items. By the way, implementing your custom layoutHelper and provding it to the framework is also supported.  "
6,94," Provide default common layout implements, decouple the View and Layout. Default layout implements are:     * LinearLayoutHelper: provide linear layout as LinearLayoutManager.     * GridLayoutHelper: privide grid layout as GridLayoutManager, but with more feature.     * FixLayoutHelper: fix the view at certain position of screen, the view does not scroll with whole page.     * ScrollFixLayoutHelper: fix the view at certain position of screen, but the view does not show until it scrolls to it position.     * FloatLayoutHelper: float the view on top of page, user can drag and drop it.     * ColumnLayoutHelper: perform like GridLayoutHelper but layouts all child views in one line.     * SingleLayoutHelper: contain only one child view.     * OnePlusNLayoutHelper: a custom layout with one child view layouted at left and the others at right, you may not need this.     * StickyLayoutHelper: scroll the view when its position is inside the screen, but fix the view at start or end when its position is outside the screen.     * StaggeredGridLayoutHelper: provide waterfall like layout as StaggeredGridLayoutManager.   * LayoutHelpers provided by default can be generally divided into two categories. One is non-fix LayoutHelper such as LinearLayoutHelper, GridLayoutHelper, etc which means the children of these LayoutHelper will be layouted in the flow of parent container and will be scrolled with the container scrolling.

9,118,Get started by clicking the Open button in Learn.  
9,119,"You will need to create a text file called hello_world.rb within the lab's directory. The .rb file extension is a common convention for specifying the language of the file - in this case, Ruby. To create this, in the Learn IDE's terminal type touch hello_world.rb. If that worked as expected, you should now see the file appear in the file browser. You can open this file by double clicking on it in the file browser or by typing atom hello_world.rb. You should now see an empty file open in your text editor, ready to be edited.  "
9,120,"In the file hello_world.rb that you created, you need to write a single line of code that prints the string Hello World! to your terminal.

9,121,"Execute this file by typing ruby hello_world.rb into your terminal and pressing enter. The ruby part of that command tells your computer to use the Ruby interpreter when reading and executing the code in your file.

14,163,"Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the @abstr_hyperlink pattern.  Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your application into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.  The _Model layer_ represents your domain model (such as Account, Product, Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to your application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You can read more about Active Record in its README. Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by the Active Model module. You can read more about Active Model in its README.  The _Controller layer_ is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers can also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load and manipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response. In Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, and controller classes are derived from ActionController::Base. Action Dispatch and Action Controller are bundled together in Action Pack. You can read more about Action Pack in its README.  The _View layer_ is composed of ""templates"" that are responsible for providing appropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded Ruby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller response, or to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View. You can read more about Action View in its README.  Active Record, Active Model, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails. In addition to that, Rails also comes with Action Mailer (README), a library to generate and send emails; Active Job (README), a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queueing backends; Action Cable (README), a framework to integrate WebSockets with a Rails application; and Active Support (README), a collection of utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails, and may also be used independently outside Rails.

15,172,"The first thing you need to do is to set the URL of your Mobile App backend in the MobileServiceClient constructor. To do this, open the ToDoActivity.cs project file, locate the applicationURL constant and replace the URL with the URL of your Mobile App backend.  "
15,173,"Because both the client and backend are configured to use authentication, you must define an authentication provider for your app and register it with your Mobile App backend in the @abstr_hyperlink .  @abstr_number . Follow the instructions in the topic to configure the Mobile App backend to use one of the following authentication providers:       + AAD     + Facebook     + Google     + Microsoft account     + Twitter   @abstr_number . By default, the app is configured to use server-directed Facebook authentication. To use a different authentication provider, change the provider by changing the value of the provider constant in ToDoActivity.cs and changing it to one of these other values: AAD, Google, MicrosoftAccount, or Twitter.  "
15,174,"You need to configure push notifications by registering your Xamarin.Android app for Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in the @abstr_hyperlink , and then storing the API key in Azure. This key is used by Azure to connect to GCM to send push notifications. Assuming that you have already created the notification hub in your backend as instructed in the server project readme, complete the following sections of the push notifications tutorial to configure push notifications:  @abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink . @abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink .  Finally, open the ToDoBroadcastReceiver.cs project file and set your Google project number in the senderIDs variable       public class ToDoBroadcastReceiver : GcmBroadcastReceiverBase     {         // Set the Google app ID.         public static string[] senderIDs = new string[] { ""MY_PROJECT_NUMBER"" };     }   "
15,175,"With both the Mobile App backend and the app configured, you can run the app project.  @abstr_number . In the Android emulator or device, make sure you have a valid Google account added.  @abstr_number . Run the app, click the Sign-in button and authenticate with the provider.       After authentication succeeds, the device is registered for push notifications and any existing data is downloaded from Azure.   @abstr_number . Stop the Windows Store app and repeat the previous steps for the Windows Phone Store app.       At this point, both devices are registered to receive push notifications.   @abstr_number . Run the Windows Store app again, and type text in Insert a TodoItem , and then click Save.       Note that after the insert completes, both the Windows Store and the Windows Phone apps receive a push notification from WNS. The notification is displayed on Windows Phone even when the app isn't running.   "
15,176,This section highlights changes made to the original tutorial samples and other design decisions were made when implementing all of the features or Mobile Apps in the same client app.  
15,177,"The original push notification tutorial used a native WNS registration. This sample has been changed to use a template registration, which makes it easier to send push notifications to users on multiple clients from a single send method call. The following code defines the toast template registration:       // Define a message body for GCM.     const string templateBodyGCM = ""{\""data\"":{\""message\"":\""$(messageParam)\""}}"";      // Define the template registration as JSON.     JObject templates = new JObject();     templates[""genericMessage""] = new JObject     {       {""body"", templateBodyGCM }     };   For more information, see @abstr_hyperlink .  "
15,178,"When a mobile app registers for push notifications using an Azure App Service Mobile Apps backend, there are two default tags that can get added to the registration in Azure Notification Hubs: the installation ID, which is unique to the app on a given device, and the user ID, which is only added when the user has been previously authenticated. Any other tags that get supplied by the client are ignored, which is by design. (Note that this differs from Mobile Services, where the client could supply any tag and there were hooks into the registration process on the backend to validate tags on incoming registrations.)  Because the client can’t add tags and at the same time there is not service-side hooks into the push notification registration process, the client needs to do the work of adding new tags to a given registration. In this sample, an /updatetags endpoint in the backend lets the client add tags to their push registration. The client calls that endpoint to create new tags, as you can see in the following:       try     {         // Define two new tags as a JSON array.         var body = new JArray();         body.Add(""broadcast"");         body.Add(""test"");          // Call the custom API '/api/updatetags/'         // with the JArray of tags.         var response = await client             .InvokeApiAsync(""updatetags/""             + client.InstallationId, body);     }     catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException ex)     {         System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(             string.Format(""Error with Azure push registration: { @abstr_number }"", ex.Message));     }   For more information, see @abstr_hyperlink .  "
15,179,"This sample is a little different from the tutorials in that push notifications are send to all devices with push registrations that belong to a specific user. When an authenticated user registers for push notifications, a tag with the user ID is automatically added. Because of this, it's important to have the user sign-in before registering for push notifications. You should also have the user sign-in before executing any data or sync requests, which will result in an exception when the endpoint requires authentication. You also probably don't want an unauthenticated user to see offline data stored on the device. The following button event handler shows how to require explicit user sign-in before push registration and doing the initial data sync:       [Java.Interop.Export()]     public async void LoginUser(View view)     {         // Only register for push notifications and load data after authentication succeeds.         if (await Authenticate())         {             // Register the app for push notifications.             GcmClient.Register(this, ToDoBroadcastReceiver.senderIDs);              //Hide the button after authentication succeeds.             FindViewById(Resource.Id.buttonLoginUser).Visibility = ViewStates.Gone;              // Load the data.             OnRefreshItemsSelected();         }     }  "

16,183,"This cookbook doesn't have direct dependencies on other cookbooks, as none are needed for the default recipe or the general use cases.  Depending on your OS configuration and security policy, you may need additional recipes or cookbooks for this cookbook's recipes to converge on the node. In particular, the following Operating System settings may affect the behavior of this cookbook:    * apt cache outdated   * SELinux enabled   * IPtables   * Compile tools   * @abstr_number rd party repositories    On Ubuntu/Debian, use Opscode's apt cookbook to ensure the package cache is updated so Chef can install packages, or consider putting apt-get in your bootstrap process or @abstr_hyperlink .  On RHEL, SELinux is enabled by default. The selinux cookbook contains a permissive recipe that can be used to set SELinux to ""Permissive"" state. Otherwise, additional recipes need to be created by the user to address SELinux permissions.  The easiest but certainly not ideal way to deal with IPtables is to flush all rules. Opscode does provide an iptables cookbook but is migrating from the approach used there to a more robust solution utilizing a general ""firewall"" LWRP that would have an ""iptables"" provider. Alternately, you can use ufw, with Opscode's ufw and firewall cookbooks to set up rules. See those cookbooks' READMEs for documentation.  Build/compile tools may not be installed on the system by default. Some recipes (e.g., apache @abstr_number ::mod_auth_openid) build the module from source. Use Opscode's build-essential cookbook to get essential build packages installed.  On ArchLinux, if you are using the apache @abstr_number ::mod_auth_openid recipe, you also need the pacman cookbook for the pacman_aur LWRP. Put recipe[pacman] on the node's expanded run list (on the node or in a role). This is not an explicit dependency because it is only required for this single recipe and platform; the pacman default recipe performs pacman -Sy to keep pacman's package cache updated.  The apache @abstr_number ::god_monitor recipe uses a definition from the god cookbook. Include recipe[god] in the node's expanded run list to ensure that the cookbook is available to the node, and to set up god.  "

16,223,"Current parameters used by the definition:    * name - The name of the site. The template will be written to #{node['apache']['dir']}/sites-available/#{params['name']}.conf   * cookbook - Optional. Cookbook where the source template is. If this is not defined, Chef will use the named template in the cookbook where the definition is used.   * template - Default web_app.conf.erb, source template file.   * enable - Default true. Passed to the apache_site definition.    Additional parameters can be defined when the definition is called in a recipe, see __Examples__.  "
16,224,"The recommended way to use the web_app definition is in a application specific cookbook named ""my_app"". The following example would look for a template named 'web_app.conf.erb' in your cookbook containing the apache httpd directives defining the VirtualHost that would serve up ""my_app"".  web_app ""my_app"" do template 'web_app.conf.erb' server_name node['my_app']['hostname'] end  All parameters are passed into the template. You can use whatever you like. The apache @abstr_number cookbook comes with a web_app.conf.erb template as an example. The following parameters are used in the template:    * server_name - ServerName directive.   * server_aliases - ServerAlias directive. Must be an array of aliases.   * docroot - DocumentRoot directive.   * application_name - Used in RewriteLog directive. Will be set to the name parameter.   * directory_index - Allow overriding the default DirectoryIndex setting, optional   * directory_options - Override Options on the docroot, for example to add parameters like Includes or Indexes, optional.   * allow_override - Modify the AllowOverride directive on the docroot to support apps that need .htaccess to modify configuration or require authentication.    To use the default web_app, for example:  web_app ""my_site"" do server_name node['hostname'] server_aliases [node['fqdn'], ""my-site.example.com""] docroot ""/srv/www/my_site"" cookbook 'apache @abstr_number ' end  The parameters specified will be used as:    * @params[:server_name]   * @params[:server_aliases]   * @params[:docroot]    In the template. When you write your own, the @ is significant.  For more information about Definitions and parameters, see the @abstr_hyperlink  "
16,225,"Using this cookbook is relatively straightforward. Add the desired recipes to the run list of a node, or create a role. Depending on your environment, you may have multiple roles that use different recipes from this cookbook. Adjust any attributes as desired. For example, to create a basic role for web servers that provide both HTTP and HTTPS:  % cat roles/webserver.rb name ""webserver"" description ""Systems that serve HTTP and HTTPS"" run_list( ""recipe[apache @abstr_number ]"", ""recipe[apache @abstr_number ::mod_ssl]"" ) default_attributes( ""apache"" => { ""listen_ports"" => ["" @abstr_number "", "" @abstr_number ""] } )  For examples of using the definitions in your own recipes, see their respective sections above.

18,242,为了方便用户，特提供内置了数据包的Portable版，只需在pom.xml加入：  @abstr_code_section  零配置，即可使用基本功能（除CRF分词、依存句法分析外的全部功能）。如果用户有自定义的需求，可以参考方式二，使用hanlp.properties进行配置。  
18,243,HanLP 将数据与程序分离，给予用户自定义的自由。  
18,244,@abstr_hyperlink  
18,245,| 数据包 | 功能 | 体积（MB） | | -------- | -----: | :----: | | @abstr_hyperlink | 全部 | @abstr_number | 下载后解压到任意目录，接下来通过配置文件告诉HanLP数据包的位置。  HanLP 中的数据分为 _词典_ 和 _模型_ ，其中 _词典_ 是词法分析必需的， _模型_ 是句法分析必需的。       data     │     ├─dictionary     └─model   用户可以自行增删替换，如果不需要句法分析功能的话，随时可以删除model文件夹。 - 模型跟词典没有绝对的区别，隐马模型被做成人人都可以编辑的词典形式，不代表它不是模型。 - GitHub代码库中已经包含了data.zip中的词典，直接编译运行自动缓存即可；模型则需要额外下载。  
18,246,示例配置文件: @abstr_hyperlink 在GitHub的发布页中，hanlp.properties一般和jar打包在同一个zip包中。  配置文件的作用是告诉HanLP数据包的位置，只需修改第一行       root=usr/home/HanLP/   为data的 父目录 即可，比如data目录是/Users/hankcs/Documents/data，那么root=/Users/hankcs/Documents/ 。    * 如果选用mini词典的话，则需要修改配置文件： @abstr_code_section    最后将HanLP.properties放入classpath即可，对于任何项目，都可以放到src或resources目录下，编译时IDE会自动将其复制到classpath中。  如果放置不当，HanLP会智能提示当前环境下的合适路径，并且尝试从项目根目录读取数据集。  
18,247,HanLP 几乎所有的功能都可以通过工具类HanLP快捷调用，当你想不起来调用方法时，只需键入HanLP.，IDE应当会给出提示，并展示 HanLP 完善的文档。  _推荐用户始终通过工具类HanLP调用，这么做的好处是，将来 HanLP 升级后，用户无需修改调用代码。_  所有Demo都位于 @abstr_hyperlink 下，比文档覆盖了更多细节，强烈建议运行一遍。  
18,248,@abstr_code_section - 内存要求 * HanLP 对词典的数据结构进行了长期的优化，可以应对绝大多数场景。哪怕 HanLP 的词典上百兆也无需担心，因为在内存中被精心压缩过。 * 如果内存非常有限，请使用小词典。 HanLP 默认使用大词典，同时提供小词典，请参考配置文件章节。 - 写给正在编译 HanLP 的开发者 * 如果你正在编译运行从Github检出的 HanLP 代码，并且没有下载data缓存，那么首次加载词典/模型会发生一个 _自动缓存_ 的过程。 * _自动缓存_ 的目的是为了加速词典载入速度，在下次载入时，缓存的词典文件会带来毫秒级的加载速度。由于词典体积很大， _自动缓存_ 会耗费一些时间，请耐心等待。 * _自动缓存_ 缓存的不是明文词典，而是双数组Trie树、DAWG、AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie等数据结构。

18,269,本章详细介绍 HanLP 中的词典格式，满足用户自定义的需要。 HanLP 中有许多词典，它们的格式都是相似的，形式都是文本文档，随时可以修改。  
18,270,词典分为词频词性词典和词频词典。    * 词频词性词典     * 每一行代表一个单词，格式遵从[单词] [词性A] [A的频次] [词性B] [B的频次] ...。   * 词频词典     * 每一行代表一个单词，格式遵从[单词] [单词的频次]。     * 每一行的分隔符为空格符或制表符    少数词典有自己的专用格式，比如同义词词典兼容《同义词词林扩展版》的文本格式，而转移矩阵词典则是一个csv表格。  下文主要介绍通用词典，如不注明，词典特指通用词典。  
18,271,Trie树（字典树）是 HanLP 中使用最多的数据结构，为此，我实现了通用的Trie树，支持泛型、遍历、储存、载入。  用户自定义词典采用AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie和二分Trie树储存，其他词典采用基于 @abstr_hyperlink 实现的 @abstr_hyperlink 。  
18,272,词典有两个形态：文本文件(filename.txt)和缓存文件(filename.txt.bin或filename.txt.trie.dat和filename.txt.trie.value)。    * 文本文件     * 采用明文储存，UTF- @abstr_number 编码，CRLF换行符。   * 缓存文件     * 就是一些二进制文件，通常在文本文件的文件名后面加上.bin表示。有时候是.trie.dat和.trie.value。后者是历史遗留产物，分别代表trie树的数组和值。     * 如果你修改了任何词典，只有删除缓存才能生效。    
18,273,HanLP的核心词典训练自人民日报 @abstr_number 语料，语料不是完美的，总会存在一些错误。这些错误可能会导致分词出现奇怪的结果，这时请打开调试模式排查问题： @abstr_code_section - 核心词性词频词典 * 比如你在data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.txt中发现了一个不是词的词，或者词性标注得明显不对，那么你可以修改它，然后删除缓存文件使其生效。 * 目前CoreNatureDictionary.ngram.txt的缓存依赖于CoreNatureDictionary.txt的缓存，修改了后者之后必须同步删除前者的缓存，否则可能出错 - 核心二元文法词典 * 二元文法词典data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.ngram.txt储存的是两个词的接续，如果你发现不可能存在这种接续时，删掉即可。 * 你也可以添加你认为合理的接续，但是这两个词必须同时在核心词典中才会生效。 - 命名实体识别词典 * 基于角色标注的命名实体识别比较依赖词典，所以词典的质量大幅影响识别质量。 * 这些词典的格式与原理都是类似的，请阅读 @abstr_hyperlink 或代码修改它。  如果问题解决了，欢迎向我提交一个pull request，这是我在代码库中保留明文词典的原因，众人拾柴火焰高！  * * *

Typically you can use another computer than the one you have used to build your story to make sure everything is loading properly. Alternatively @abstr_hyperlink will show you how to configure your browser for an incognito session or you can just sign-out from ArcGIS Online and any service that you have used to host your Journal's resources. - Try the application on different browsers, screen resolutions and mobile devices.

If you remove or reorder your sections, you will have to modify the links manually.  You can also add that capability to map feature popups. This can for example allow the home section map to be the spatial index to your story. To do that you need to download the application and include a piece of code in index.html, look at the end of the file and modify it as below.

It is not possible to display an authentication dialog in the Map Journal when the Journal is hosted in ArcGIS Online.  When the Journal is hosted on your web server, an authentication dialog will appear inside the application.  Note that for that authentication to work on some older browser (Internet Explorer @abstr_number ) you need to install a proxy server on your web server to make sure the login credentials can be passed securely to ArcGIS Online. For more information, see the @abstr_hyperlink in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation.  Because of that limitation, we recommend that you configure the application to use OAuth. OAuth @abstr_number . @abstr_number based authentication is available for ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS users with developer or organizational accounts. Follow the procedure to @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink to get an OAuth application ID. Once you have that application, open index.html, locate the configOptions section and fill the oAuthAppId property.  If you are using secured services but don't want users to have to authenticate, you can use a proxy to store the username/password to be used, see @abstr_hyperlink , and add a proxy rules to specify what services need to use the proxy by editing PROXY_RULES in app/config.js.

25,338,This is not a supported use case at that time. Please let us know if you are interested by such a scenario. Map Journal rely heavily on the Portal for ArcGIS API but it is doable to modify the application to support other scenarios.  
25,339,"The Journal's data are stored in a Web Application Item in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This include the narrative content, reference to the webmap(s), reference to picture(s), video(s), web page(s) and the settings.  The image and videos that you include in your Journal using the builder are not copied in ArcGIS Online. You have to make sure that those medias as well as the webmaps you are using are and will remain accessible to your audience.  "
25,340,"Yes, Map Journal is included with Portal for ArcGIS starting at version @abstr_number . @abstr_number .  If you are using Portal @abstr_number . @abstr_number + and want to update Map Journal, @abstr_hyperlink . If you are using Portal @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number or @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number , you can't deploy the latest version of Map Journal and have to deploy the following version @abstr_hyperlink .  Then: - Find your Portal apps/MapJournal folder (depending on your installation and version of Portal, this is either C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Portal\apps\MapSeries or C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Portal\webapps\arcgis#home\webmap\templates\MapJournal). - Remove the content of that folder - Extract the archive so that index.html is located at MapJournal\index.html  If Map Journal was already included in your Portal you are done (Portal for ArcGIS @abstr_number . @abstr_number +).  If Map Journal was not available in your Portal: - Log into Portal for ArcGIS and open My Content > Add Item > Application > Web Mapping Application > Configurable. Configure the URL to https://portal.domain.com/arcgis/apps/MapJournal. More details in the following documentation @abstr_hyperlink . - Create a new group that will reference the template available in your Portal - Share the newly created item with that group - Open My Organization > Edit Settings > Map and set the Web App Templates to the newly created group. More details in the following documentation @abstr_hyperlink - Now when you share a web map, the template should be an option  _Note that the archive you downloaded is using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript hosted in ArcGIS Online. This can create some incompatibility with your Portal, if you run into issue, please see the next section to update it._  Also note that the web application gallery preview feature redirects to the StoryMaps website, the target page can be modified in app/config.js > HELP_URL_PORTAL.  "
25,341,"Yes, by using Portal for ArcGIS and configuring the template to use the ArcGIS API for Javascript included with the Portal.  To edit the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, edit index.html and locate pathJSAPI around line @abstr_number . The URL is //webadaptor.domain.com/arcgis/jsapi/jsapi where arcgis is the name of your Web Adaptor.  When deployed on a Portal for ArcGIS instance, the application doesn't require any external service to function. But by default the template will still include the header social buttons and Journal author are able to import pictures and videos from the some online pictures hosting services. These options can be disabled individually through the configuration file app/config.js.  "
25,342,"Yes, when the template is configured with an application ID, adding the URL parameter 'edit' will open the builder. You will be prompted for user authentication through the Identity Manager.  "
25,343,"If you are not familiar with web servers here is three solutions: * Use a free hosting service like @abstr_hyperlink , you may have to @abstr_hyperlink * Use the web server that comes with your server Operating System. On Windows this is Internet Information Services (IIS), if you have a C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder on your computer, you should be able to access it's content using http://localhost * On Windows or Mac OS, use a simple web server like @abstr_hyperlink (not recommended for production)  If you are experiencing some rendering issues like improper symbol appearing instead of icons, you will have an extra configuration to perform. Some servers require to configure a new mime type to be able to serve Map Journal fonts correctly. See the following links for more information:    * @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink    "
25,344,"Yes. If you have customized the application and deployed it on your server, you don't need to copy it multiple times, edit index.html and paste a different application ID for each story you want to publish.  Instead edit index.html, locate the configOptions section and fill the authorizedOwners property with the ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS login of the owner(s) of the Journals you want to use. This make possible for the application to display any of the Journal created by the specified user(s) through an URL parameter.  Example of the same application displaying two stories: * http://myserver.com/MapJournal/index.html?appid=c @abstr_number ad @abstr_number a @abstr_number de @abstr_number a @abstr_number a @abstr_number f @abstr_number a @abstr_number * http://myserver.com/MapJournal/index.html?appid=c @abstr_number ad @abstr_number a @abstr_number de @abstr_number a @abstr_number a @abstr_number f @abstr_number a @abstr_number  "
25,345,"In addition to the configuration offered by the builder, the file app/config.js provide various additional settings. This is for example the place where you can override some settings like the list of Geocoder services to be used (changes override ArcGIS Online or your Organization default settings). See the documentation provided in that file for more details.  "
25,346, 
25,347,"As Map Journal doesn't yet offer the ability to create a custom theme through the builder, customizing the various colors of the application require to download and configure them through app/config.js.  For example if you are using a Side Panel layout and have kept the default theme, open app/config.js, locate the LAYOUT property and edit the following line with the desired colors.  @abstr_code_section  "
25,348,"Most of the look and feel customization can be done using the @abstr_hyperlink and including the css/html overrides directly into index.html.  As the application Javascript and CSS are minified, we don't recommend that you directely edit those files (e.g. app-viewer-min.css, app-viewer-min.js, ...). In addition to being hard to edit, this will make application update complex for you.  If you want to change the behavior of one functionality or want to add new one, follow the developer guide below.  The easiest way to find the id or path of a DOM element that you want to customize is to use your browser developer tool, read documentation for @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink .  Here is some customization examples that can achieved through the style tag already present for you in index.html (search for /* CUSTOM CSS RULES */):  "

25,350,"This developer guide is intended for developers that wants to modify the behavior or add new functionalities to the Map Journal application. It requires knowledge of HTML, Javascript and CSS languages. If you only need to customize look and feel, you should be able to do so using the customize section above.  "
25,351,"Map Journal fires events that allow customization with lose integration. This mean that you don't need to understand the application internals to implement simple extension.  To try those events, look for the Custom Javascript block at the far end of index.html.  @abstr_code_section  "
25,352,"In addition to the events described above, the story data, configuration and useful helpers functions can be accessed through the global variable app.  @abstr_code_section  Some events are also available for you to navigate the Journal programmatically:  @abstr_code_section  "
25,353,"Clone the repository or download a @abstr_hyperlink .  To build a production version of the application from the source code, you first need to install @abstr_hyperlink .  Then initialize the environment by running the following commands in the MapJournal folder : * npm install * npm install –g grunt-cli  This will create a new node-modules folder in your project root with all the tools required to build the application. If you have trouble running the second command, @abstr_hyperlink .  "
25,354," Make accessible the MapJournal folder on a web server. Use your favorite server or run one with grunt server, this will start a server on port @abstr_number   * If using a Portal for ArcGIS instance configure the sharing url app/config.js (last property)   * Use the URL parameter appid to specify the web item to be loaded, e.g.: http://localhost: @abstr_number /?appid=ABCD (configuring index.html > configOptions.appid is not supported in development mode)     "
25,355, Open a terminal and navigate to the MapJournal folder   * Run the following command: grunt    The deploy folder now contains the built application that you can deploy to your web server.   
25,356,"The build script perform code validation through @abstr_hyperlink , you can disable those validations by editing Gruntfile.js and look for the following comments /* Comment out to disable code linting */.  "
25,357,"Map Journal relies on AMD and Dojo loader @abstr_hyperlink for application structure.

26,361,"@abstr_hyperlink  @abstr_image  @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink  TensorLayer is a Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) library extended from @abstr_hyperlink . It provides popular DL and RL modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems.   TensorLayer grow out from a need to combine the power of TensorFlow with the right building modules for deep neural networks. According to our years of research and practical experiences of tackling real-world machine learning problems, we come up with three design goals for TensorLayer:    * Simplicity : We make TensorLayer easy to work with by providing mass tutorials that can be deployed and run through in minutes. A TensorFlow user may find it easier to bootstrap with the simple, high-level APIs provided by TensorLayer, and then deep dive into their implementation details if need.   * Flexibility : Developing an effective DL algorithm for a specific domain typically requires careful tunings from many aspects. Without the loss of simplicity, TensorLayer allows users to customize their modules by manipulating the native APIs of TensorFlow (e.g., training parameters, iteration control and tensor components).   * Performance : TensorLayer aims to provide zero-cost abstraction for TensorFlow. With its first-class support for TensorFlow, it can easily run on either heterogeneous platforms or multiple computation nodes without compromise in performance.    A frequent question regarding TensorLayer is that why do we develop a new library instead of leveraging existing ones like @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink . TensorLayer differentiates with those with its pursuits for flexibility and performance. A DL user may find it comfortable to bootstrap with Keras and Tflearn. These libraries provide high-level abstractions and hide engine implementation details from users. Though good for using, it becomes hard to tune and modify from the bottom, which is necessary when addressing domain-specific problems (i.e., one model does not fit all). Nevertheless, flexibility does not always come with the loss of performance. TensorLayer allows seamless distributed and heterogeneous deployment with its first-class support for the TensorFlow runtime.  "
26,362,"TensorLayer has install prerequisites including TensorFlow, numpy and matplotlib. For GPU support, CUDA and cuDNN are required. Please check @abstr_hyperlink for detailed instructions.  If you already had the pre-requisites ready, the simplest way to install TensorLayer in your python program is:  @abstr_code_section  "

26,364,"The first program trains a multi-layer perception network to solve the MNIST problem. We use the well-known @abstr_hyperlink -style functions such as fit() and test(). The program is self-explained.  @abstr_code_section  We provide many helper functions (like fit() , test()) that is similar to Keras to facilitate your development; however, if you want to obtain a fine-grain control over the model or its training process, you can use TensorFlow’s methods like sess.run() in your program directly (tutorial_mnist.py provides more details about this).

29,414,"@abstr_image  fog is the Ruby cloud services library, top to bottom:    * Collections provide a simplified interface, making clouds easier to work with and switch between.   * Requests allow power users to get the most out of the features of each individual cloud.   * Mocks make testing and integrating a breeze.    @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink   Currently all fog providers are getting separated into metagems to lower the load time and dependency count.  If there's a metagem available for your cloud provider, e.g. fog-aws, you should be using it instead of requiring the full fog collection to avoid unnecessary dependencies.  'fog' should be required explicitly only if: - The provider you use doesn't yet have a metagem available. - You require Ruby @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number support.  "
29,415,The easiest way to learn fog is to install the gem and use the interactive console. Here is an example of wading through server creation for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud:  @abstr_code_section  
29,416,Fog requires Ruby @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number or later.  Ruby @abstr_number . @abstr_number and @abstr_number . @abstr_number support was dropped in fog-v @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number as a backwards incompatible change. Please use the later fog @abstr_number .x versions if you require @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number or @abstr_number . @abstr_number .x support.  
29,417,"A high level interface to each cloud is provided through collections, such as images and servers. You can see a list of available collections by calling collections on the connection object. You can try it out using the fog command:       >> Compute[:aws].collections     [:addresses, :directories, ..., :volumes, :zones]   Some collections are available across multiple providers:    * compute providers have flavors, images and servers   * dns providers have zones and records   * storage providers have directories and files    Collections share basic CRUD type operations, such as:    * all - fetch every object of that type from the provider.   * create - initialize a new record locally and a remote resource with the provider.   * get - fetch a single object by its identity from the provider.   * new - initialize a new record locally, but do not create a remote resource with the provider.    As an example, we'll try initializing and persisting a Rackspace Cloud server:  @abstr_code_section  "
29,418, 
29,419, 
29,420,"Many of the collection methods return individual objects, which also provide common methods:    * destroy - will destroy the persisted object from the provider   * save - persist the object to the provider   * wait_for - takes a block and waits for either the block to return true for the object or for a timeout (defaults to @abstr_number minutes)    "
29,421,"As you might imagine, testing code using Fog can be slow and expensive, constantly turning on and shutting down instances. Mocking allows skipping this overhead by providing an in memory representation of resources as you make requests. Enabling mocking is easy to use: before you run other commands, simply run:  @abstr_code_section  Then proceed as usual, if you run into unimplemented mocks, fog will raise an error and as always contributions are welcome!  "
29,422,"Requests allow you to dive deeper when the models just can't cut it. You can see a list of available requests by calling #requests on the connection object.  For instance, ec @abstr_number provides methods related to reserved instances that don't have any models (yet). Here is how you can lookup your reserved instances:       $ fog     >> Compute[:aws].describe_reserved_instances     #body, headers and status. Both return nice hashes.  "
29,423,"Play around and use the console to explore or check out @abstr_hyperlink and the @abstr_hyperlink for more details and examples. Once you are ready to start scripting fog, here is a quick hint on how to make connections without the command line thing to help you.  @abstr_code_section  geemus says: ""That should give you everything you need to get started, but let me know if there is anything I can do to help!""

29,428,"Fog library aims to adhere to @abstr_hyperlink , although it does not address challenges of multi-provider libraries. Semantic versioning is only guaranteed for the common API, not any provider-specific extensions. You may also need to update your configuration from time to time (even between Fog releases) as providers update or deprecate services.  However, we still aim for forwards compatibility within Fog major versions.

For instance, new fragment can be launched from another one with action's request (using request code) and then recieve the result.  FragmentSwapper works with Android Support Library.  In order to manage multiple fragments, FragmentSwapper object is required.  Each fragment must implement FragmentDescriptor interface. Its example implementation is provided in BaseFragment class. BaseFragment can be also used as a base class in your application.  Currently, it is possible to manage fragments within one container, using SingleContainerFragmentSwapper class.  For information how to initialize the SingleContainerFragmentSwapper, and how to implement fragment swapping please check sample application and the library code.  "

36,477,"Deltas are a simple, yet expressive format that can be used to describe contents and changes. The format is JSON based, and is human readable, yet easily parsible by machines. Deltas can describe any rich text document, includes all text and formatting information, without the ambiguity and complexity of HTML.  A Delta is made up of an @abstr_hyperlink of Operations, which describe changes to a document. They can be an insert, delete or retain. Note operations do not take an index. They always describe the change at the current index. Use retains to ""keep"" or ""skip"" certain parts of the document.  Don’t be confused by its name Delta—Deltas represents both documents and changes to documents. If you think of Deltas as the instructions from going from one document to another, the way Deltas represent a document is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document.  "

37,581,"Masonry is still actively maintained, we are committed to fixing bugs and merging good quality PRs from the wider community. However if you're using Swift in your project, we recommend using @abstr_hyperlink as it provides better type safety with a simpler API.  Masonry is a light-weight layout framework which wraps AutoLayout with a nicer syntax. Masonry has its own layout DSL which provides a chainable way of describing your NSLayoutConstraints which results in layout code that is more concise and readable. Masonry supports iOS and Mac OS X.  For examples take a look at the Masonry iOS Examples project in the Masonry workspace. You will need to run pod install after downloading.  "
37,582,"Under the hood Auto Layout is a powerful and flexible way of organising and laying out your views. However creating constraints from code is verbose and not very descriptive. Imagine a simple example in which you want to have a view fill its superview but inset by @abstr_number pixels on every side @abstr_code_section Even with such a simple example the code needed is quite verbose and quickly becomes unreadable when you have more than @abstr_number or @abstr_number views. Another option is to use Visual Format Language (VFL), which is a bit less long winded. However the ASCII type syntax has its own pitfalls and its also a bit harder to animate as NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat: returns an array.  "
37,583,Heres the same constraints created using MASConstraintMaker  @abstr_code_section Or even shorter  @abstr_code_section  Also note in the first example we had to add the constraints to the superview [superview addConstraints:.... Masonry however will automagically add constraints to the appropriate view.  Masonry will also call view @abstr_number .translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO; for you.  
37,584, .equalTo equivalent to NSLayoutRelationEqual  > .lessThanOrEqualTo equivalent to NSLayoutRelationLessThanOrEqual  > .greaterThanOrEqualTo equivalent to NSLayoutRelationGreaterThanOrEqual  These three equality constraints accept one argument which can be any of the following:   
37,585,@abstr_code_section  MASViewAttribute | NSLayoutAttribute ------------------------- | -------------------------- view.mas_left | NSLayoutAttributeLeft view.mas_right | NSLayoutAttributeRight view.mas_top | NSLayoutAttributeTop view.mas_bottom | NSLayoutAttributeBottom view.mas_leading | NSLayoutAttributeLeading view.mas_trailing | NSLayoutAttributeTrailing view.mas_width | NSLayoutAttributeWidth view.mas_height | NSLayoutAttributeHeight view.mas_centerX | NSLayoutAttributeCenterX view.mas_centerY | NSLayoutAttributeCenterY view.mas_baseline | NSLayoutAttributeBaseline  
37,586,if you want view.left to be greater than or equal to label.left : @abstr_code_section  
37,587,"Auto Layout allows width and height to be set to constant values. if you want to set view to have a minimum and maximum width you could pass a number to the equality blocks: @abstr_code_section  However Auto Layout does not allow alignment attributes such as left, right, centerY etc to be set to constant values. So if you pass a NSNumber for these attributes Masonry will turn these into constraints relative to the view’s superview ie: @abstr_code_section  Instead of using NSNumber, you can use primitives and structs to build your constraints, like so: @abstr_code_section  By default, macros which support @abstr_hyperlink are prefixed with mas_.

37,593,@abstr_code_section  You can chain view attributes for increased readability:  @abstr_code_section  
37,594,Sometimes you need modify existing constraints in order to animate or remove/replace constraints. In Masonry there are a few different approaches to updating constraints.  
37,595,You can hold on to a reference of a particular constraint by assigning the result of a constraint make expression to a local variable or a class property. You could also reference multiple constraints by storing them away in an array.  @abstr_code_section  
37,596,Alternatively if you are only updating the constant value of the constraint you can use the convience method mas_updateConstraints instead of mas_makeConstraints  @abstr_code_section  
37,597,"mas_updateConstraints is useful for updating a set of constraints, but doing anything beyond updating constant values can get exhausting. That's where mas_remakeConstraints comes in.  mas_remakeConstraints is similar to mas_updateConstraints, but instead of updating constant values, it will remove all of its constraints before installing them again. This lets you provide different constraints without having to keep around references to ones which you want to remove.  @abstr_code_section  You can find more detailed examples of all three approaches in the Masonry iOS Examples project.  "
37,598,"Laying out your views doesn't always goto plan. So when things literally go pear shaped, you don't want to be looking at console output like this:  @abstr_code_section  Masonry adds a category to NSLayoutConstraint which overrides the default implementation of - (NSString *)description. Now you can give meaningful names to views and constraints, and also easily pick out the constraints created by Masonry.  which means your console output can now look like this:  @abstr_code_section  For an example of how to set this up take a look at the Masonry iOS Examples project in the Masonry workspace.

42,647,@abstr_code_section  
42,648,@abstr_code_section Navigate to http://localhost: @abstr_number /. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  You can configure the default HTTP port and the one used by the LiveReload server with two command-line options :  @abstr_code_section  
42,649,You can use the ng generate (or just ng g) command to generate Angular components:  @abstr_code_section You can find all possible blueprints in the table below:  Scaffold | Usage --- | --- Component | ng g component my-new-component Directive | ng g directive my-new-directive Pipe | ng g pipe my-new-pipe Service | ng g service my-new-service Class | ng g class my-new-class Interface | ng g interface my-new-interface Enum | ng g enum my-new-enum Module | ng g module my-module

42,653, 
42,654, 
42,655,"The CLI supports routing in several ways:    * We include the @angular/router NPM package when creating or initializing a project.    * When you generate a module, you can use the --routing option like ng g module my-module --routing to create a separate file my-module-routing.module.ts to store the module routes.  The file includes an empty Routes object that you can fill with routes to different components and/or modules.  The --routing option also generates a default component with the same name as the module.    * You can use the --routing option with ng new or ng init to create a app-routing.module.ts file when you create or initialize a project.     "
42,656,@abstr_code_section  The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.  
42,657,"ng build can specify both a build target (--target=production or --target=development) and an environment file to be used with that build (--environment=dev or --environment=prod). By default, the development build target and environment are used.  The mapping used to determine which environment file is used can be found in angular-cli.json:  @abstr_code_section  These options also apply to the serve command. If you do not pass a value for environment, it will default to dev for development and prod for production.  @abstr_code_section  You can also add your own env files other than dev and prod by doing the following: - create a src/environments/environment.NAME.ts - add { ""NAME"": 'src/environments/environment.NAME.ts' } to the apps[ @abstr_number ].environments object in angular-cli.json - use them via the --env=NAME flag on the build/serve commands.

42,661, 
42,662,"All builds make use of bundling, and using the --prod flag in ng build --prod or ng serve --prod will also make use of uglifying and tree-shaking functionality.  "
42,663,"@abstr_code_section  Tests will execute after a build is executed via @abstr_hyperlink , and it will automatically watch your files for changes. You can run tests a single time via --watch=false or --single-run.  You can run tests with coverage via --code-coverage. The coverage report will be in the coverage/ directory.  Linting during tests is also available via the --lint flag. See Linting and formatting code chapter for more informations.  "
42,664,@abstr_code_section  Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.  End-to-end tests are run via @abstr_hyperlink .  
42,665,Using the proxying support in webpack's dev server we can highjack certain urls and send them to a backend server. We do this by passing a file to --proxy-config  Say we have a server running on http://localhost: @abstr_number /api and we want all calls to http://localhost: @abstr_number /api to go to that server.  We create a file next to projects package.json called proxy.conf.json with the content  @abstr_code_section  You can read more about what options are available here @abstr_hyperlink  and then we edit the package.json file's start script to be  @abstr_code_section  now run it with npm start  
42,666,"You can deploy your apps quickly via:  @abstr_code_section  This will do the following:    * creates GitHub repo for the current project if one doesn't exist   * rebuilds the app in production mode at the current HEAD   * creates a local gh-pages branch if one doesn't exist   * moves your app to the gh-pages branch and creates a commit   * edit the base tag in index.html to support GitHub Pages   * pushes the gh-pages branch to GitHub   * returns back to the original HEAD    Creating the repo requires a token from GitHub, and the remaining functionality relies on ssh authentication for all git operations that communicate with github.com. To simplify the authentication, be sure to @abstr_hyperlink .  If you are deploying a @abstr_hyperlink , you can instead use the following command:  @abstr_code_section  This command pushes the app to the master branch on the GitHub repo instead of pushing to gh-pages, since user and organization pages require this.  "
42,667,You can lint your app code by running ng lint. This will use the lint npm script that in generated projects uses tslint.  You can modify the these scripts in package.json to run whatever tool you prefer.  
42,668,To turn on auto completion use the following commands:  For bash: @abstr_code_section  For zsh: @abstr_code_section  Windows users using gitbash: @abstr_code_section  
42,669,You use the assets array in angular-cli.json to list files or folders you want to copy as-is when building your project: @abstr_code_section  
42,670,"The styles.css file allows users to add global styles and supports @abstr_hyperlink .  If the project is created with the --style=sass option, this will be a .sass file instead, and the same applies to scss/less/styl.  You can add more global styles via the apps[ @abstr_number ].styles property in angular-cli.json.  "
42,671,Angular-CLI supports all major CSS preprocessors: - sass/scss ( @abstr_hyperlink ) - less ( @abstr_hyperlink ) - stylus ( @abstr_hyperlink )  To use these preprocessors simply add the file to your component's styleUrls:  @abstr_code_section  When generating a new project you can also define which extension you want for style files:  @abstr_code_section  Or set the default style on an existing project:  @abstr_code_section  
42,672,"Simply install your library via npm install lib-name --save and import it in your code.  If the library does not include typings, you can install them using npm:  @abstr_code_section  If the library doesn't have typings available at @types/, you can still use it by manually adding typings for it:  @abstr_number . First, create a typings.d.ts file in your src/ folder. This file will be automatically included as global type definition.  @abstr_number . Then, in src/typings.d.ts, add the following code:  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_number . Finally, in the component or file that uses the library, add the following code:  @abstr_code_section  Done. Note: you might need or find useful to define more typings for the library that you're trying to use.  "
42,673,"Some javascript libraries need to be added to the global scope, and loaded as if they were in a script tag. We can do this using the apps[ @abstr_number ].scripts and apps[ @abstr_number ].styles properties of angular-cli.json.  As an example, to use @abstr_hyperlink this is what you need to do:  First install Bootstrap from npm:  @abstr_code_section  Then add the needed script files to apps[ @abstr_number ].scripts:  @abstr_code_section  Finally add the Bootstrap CSS to the apps[ @abstr_number ].styles array: @abstr_code_section  Restart ng serve if you're running it, and Bootstrap @abstr_number should be working on your app.  "
42,674,"To update angular-cli to a new version, you must update both the global package and your project's local package.  Global package: @abstr_code_section  Local project package: @abstr_code_section  Running ng init will check for changes in all the auto-generated files created by ng new and allow you to update yours. You are offered four choices for each changed file: y (overwrite), n (don't overwrite), d (show diff between your file and the updated file) and h (help).  Carefully read the diffs for each code file, and either accept the changes or incorporate them manually after ng init finishes.  The main cause of errors after an update is failing to incorporate these updates into your code.  You can find more details about changes between versions in @abstr_hyperlink .  "
42,675, 
42,676,"@abstr_code_section  npm link is very similar to npm install -g except that instead of downloading the package from the repo, the just cloned angular-cli/ folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the angular-cli/ folder will immediately affect the global angular-cli package, allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.  Now you can use angular-cli via the command line:  @abstr_code_section  npm link angular-cli is needed because by default the globally installed angular-cli just loads the local angular-cli from the project which was fetched remotely from npm. npm link angular-cli symlinks the global angular-cli package to the local angular-cli package. Now the angular-cli you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the angular-cli project you just created.  You can also use ng new foo --link-cli to automatically link the angular-cli package.  Please read the official @abstr_hyperlink and the @abstr_hyperlink for more information.  "

45,692,"Advanced Architecture to validate TLS certificates   The aim of this work is to try validate each TLS-connection with different techniques that exist nowadays. We are living in a world that everything is connected through internet and to provide security on this connections the majority of them use TLS. But we have seen how some governments use different aproach to circumvent them. Some of this vulnerabilities can be due to bugs in the implementations, bad deployments ... etc, but one of the vulnerability that this work try to resolve is the bad or poor validation of certificates.  Before to send our private data to the other entity, usually in TLS, we have to validate the authenticity of the server with the goal to know that it is who claim it is. We have seen how apple failed in this due to the famous goto fail bug . Although is true that this vulnerability is because of a bad implementation is true that if apple had provided other techniques this situation could be discovered before. Our goal will be to validate each connection with different techniques because maybe an approach says that our connection is secure but perhaps there is another one that says the opposite providing a better solution.

Requests are not being made via XHR because of the same-origin policy. Fortunately, the Amazon autocompletion endpoint is JSONP enabled so we can bypass this restriction.   * Multiple instances : You can have multiple search fields in the same page all of them powered with Amazon Autocomplete. Don’t worry about setting different callbacks when fetching the Amazon autocompletion endpoint. Just create a new instance for each search field and this plugin will automagically handle everything for you. How cool huh?   * Keyup debounced : With great power comes great responsibility. You don’t want to execute a GET request each time the user types a character and overload the Amazon autocompletion engine server.

51,742,"As you know, while coding we are generally trying to not repeat our code. If we see a repeated chunk of code in different methods, we sometimes extract that chunk of code into its own method, which we can then reference in multiple places.  We can apply a similar tool to reduce repetition in HTML. Partials are view-level files that only form one part of an HTML page. By using a partial, we can remove repeated pieces of HTML and add better organization to the code in our views.  Let's look at an example to see what this means.  "
51,743,"Before we get started, make sure that you run rake db:seed to seed the database. This will give us some posts and authors. Because we want to focus on partials, you'll notice some hard-coding in the controller. In the posts#create action, we've hard-coded that every new post created is linked to the very first author in the database.  OK, let's dive in!  This is the code in the posts#new form: @abstr_code_section And this is the code in the posts#edit form: @abstr_code_section  Except for the first line of the form, the code is pretty much the same! The labels and field tags are the same. All of that duplication is not good in code. Duplication means twice the amount of code to maintain, twice the opportunity for bugs, and two slightly different forms when our interface should be consistent.  Instead of duplicating all of that code, we just want to write it once in our partial and call it from both our edit and show views. Here's how:  First, let's create a new file in app/views/posts/ called _form.html.erb. To indicate that this file is a partial (and only part of a larger view), an underscore is prefixed to the filename.  Second, let's remove the repeated code in app/views/posts/edit.html.erb. The file should look like this:  @abstr_code_section Note that we left in the non-duplicated code. Now, let's also remove the duplicated code in the app/views/posts/new.html.erb file. The file should look like this:  @abstr_code_section We left the code that is unique to each view and removed the duplicated code inside the form_tag blocks.  So, now what? It looks like we are missing a bunch of code in our posts/new and posts/edit files. Not to worry –– that's where our partial comes in handy.  First, we'll place the duplicated code in a new file called app/views/posts/_form.html.erb. The file should look as follows: @abstr_code_section Next, we need to render the code into the posts/edit and posts/new pages by placing <%= render ""form"" %> where we want the code in the partial to be rendered. Notice that, while the file name of our partial starts with an underscore, when we reference it there is no underscore.  Our posts/new file should now look like this: @abstr_code_section  And our posts/edit file like this: @abstr_code_section  And that's it –– we're all done!  A couple of things to note: @abstr_number . Notice that, even though the last line of the form (the <% end %> tag) is duplicated code, we didn't move it into the partial. This is because it closes the beginning of the form_tag block, which DOES differ from form to form. We don't want to open our form_tag block in one file and close it in a different file. This is a stylistic point that you will get a feel for over time.  @abstr_number . We could have named the partial whatever we wanted to. The only requirements are that it start with an underscore and that references to the partial are made without the underscore. But, just like method names, it's good to make the names of our partials as commonsensical as possible.  @abstr_number . We were able to reference the partial by just calling <%= render 'form' %>. Notice that we didn't specify the folder that the partial lives in, such as <%= render 'posts/form' %>. The reason we didn't need this (even though it would have worked if we had included it) is that both the posts/new and posts/edit files are referencing a partial housed in the same folder in which they reside, app/views/posts. When referencing a partial from a different folder, we must include the folder name as well (e.g., <%= render 'posts/form' %> as opposed to <%= render 'form' %>).  "
51,744,"Let's take a look at our authors/show.html.erb file:  @abstr_code_section  And now look at the code in posts/show.html.erb:  @abstr_code_section  See the repetition? In both places, we are using the Author object to call the .name and .hometown methods. The first thing we have to fix is the slight difference between the templates. Let's make the beginning portion of the posts/show template match the authors/show template.  @abstr_code_section  Then, let's make a new partial called app/views/authors/_author.html.erb and place the repeated code in the file. It should look like the following:  @abstr_code_section  Now we can just render this partial in our authors/show page by doing the following:  @abstr_code_section  Let's try making the same change to our posts/show page:  @abstr_code_section  Uh oh, something went wrong. This won't work because, if we don't specify the partial's parent folder, Rails assumes that the partial lives in the same folder as the view that's calling it. In this case, it looks for a file in the posts directory called _author.html.erb and doesn't find it. We need to tell Rails to go outside the folder by being explicit about the folder and file name that it should render. We can do that by changing the above code to the following:  @abstr_code_section  We're almost there! One more problem is that our partial assumes it has access to an instance variable called @author. The partial won't function without it! We'll need to modify the PostsController to have it set that instance variable.  Change the posts#show action in the controller to look like the following:  @abstr_code_section  And now we are done!

It also assumes that you have a file named @abstr_hyperlink otherwise it will copy your local npm modules:  @abstr_code_section  We have assembled a Best Practices Guide for those using these images on a daily basis.  
53,759,"For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete Dockerfile. In such cases, you can run a Node.js script by using the Node.js Docker image directly:  @abstr_code_section  "
53,760,"By default the Node.js Docker Image has npm log verbosity set to info instead of the default warn. This is because of the way Docker is isolated from the host operating system and you are not guaranteed to be able to retrieve the npm-debug.log file when npm fails.  When npm fails, it writes it's verbose log to a log file inside the container. If npm fails during an install when building a Docker Image with the docker build command, this log file will become inaccessible when Docker exits.  The Docker Working Group have chosen to be overly verbose during a build to provide an easy audit trail when install fails. If you prefer npm to be less verbose you can easily reset the verbosity of npm using the following techniques:  "

53,765,"This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of @abstr_hyperlink . buildpack-deps is designed for the average user of docker who has many images on their system. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages. This reduces the number of packages that images that derive from it need to install, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.  "
53,766,"This image is based on the popular @abstr_hyperlink , available in @abstr_hyperlink . Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~ @abstr_number MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.  This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use @abstr_hyperlink instead of @abstr_hyperlink , so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See @abstr_hyperlink for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.  To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as git or bash) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the @abstr_hyperlink for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).  "
53,767,"This image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating a Dockerfile in the base of your project directory with the line FROM node:onbuild will be enough to create a stand-alone image for your project.  While the onbuild variant is really useful for ""getting off the ground running"" (zero to Dockerized in a short period of time), it's not recommended for long-term usage within a project due to the lack of control over _when_ the ONBUILD triggers fire (see also @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink ).  Once you've got a handle on how your project functions within Docker, you'll probably want to adjust your Dockerfile to inherit from a non-onbuild variant and copy the commands from the onbuild variant Dockerfile (moving the ONBUILD lines to the end and removing the ONBUILD keywords) into your own file so that you have tighter control over them and more transparency for yourself and others looking at your Dockerfile as to what it does. This also makes it easier to add additional requirements as time goes on (such as installing more packages before performing the previously-ONBUILD steps).  This onbuild variant will only install npm packages according to the package.json and _does not_ adhere to the npm-shrinkwrap.json (see full discussion in @abstr_hyperlink .  Note that npm installs devDependencies by default, which is undesirable if you're building a production image. To avoid this pass NODE_ENV as a build argument i.e. docker build --build-arg NODE_ENV=production ….  "
53,768,"This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run node.

In particular, we will be using the ""Individual household electric power consumption Data Set"" which I have made available on the course web site:    * Dataset : @abstr_hyperlink [ @abstr_number Mb]    * Description : Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost @abstr_number years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.     The following descriptions of the @abstr_number variables in the dataset are taken from the @abstr_hyperlink :    1. Date : Date in format dd/mm/yyyy   2. Time : time in format hh:mm:ss   3. Global_active_power : household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)   4. Global_reactive_power : household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)   5. Voltage : minute-averaged voltage (in volt)   6. Global_intensity : household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)   7. Sub_metering_ @abstr_number : energy sub-metering No. @abstr_number (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).   8. Sub_metering_ @abstr_number : energy sub-metering No. @abstr_number (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.   9. Sub_metering_ @abstr_number : energy sub-metering No. @abstr_number (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.    "

55,781,初入广金时，我就发现广金跟大多数学校不同。 相比于很多高校来说，他太年轻了，缺失太多东西。 以网络空间为例，虽然有广金后院的存在，但是已经名存实亡，广金连一个稳定的学生虚拟社区都不存在，只能是去微博树洞。  我始终认为，BBS类的应用在高校中是很有必要存在的。 微博这类碎片化的应用，不利于学生利用网络来沉淀学识。 百度贴吧本来是个好的平台，但是自主性有太低了。  所以我决定自己动手，建设一个无盈利，纯为学生服务的网上社区。  广金在线是我大二时创建的项目，当时想法很天真，以为自己看到这方面的实际空缺，那么只要开发出产品了，就一定能抢占局面。  事实证明我犯了大多数技术人的错误：太着重技术。  在beta版本推出后，我就尝试去组建团队，寻找更多人来支持这个项目。 但是这时我发现，团队人员很难招募，因为我坚持非盈利，所以很多人都对项目兴趣不大。  所以初期我只能是邀请了我女友做宣传工作，可惜人力微小，收效很低。  既然无法搞好宣传，那我就专心搞技术吧。 再之后的好几个月时间，我努力去完善该站，希望能吸引更多人：换上支持响应式的bootstrap，天天琢磨着如何开发更有用的功能。  可惜啊，ALL FALSE.  在认真考虑一段时间后，我决定把www.gdufer.com开源。 一是为开源世界奉献一份力量； 二也是希望以后的广金师弟师妹如果有同样的想法，可以节省精力，集中精力去完成自己的理想目标。  
55,782,GDUFER整站是由PHP+MySQL组成，其中PHP源码基于Kohana出发。  Kohana是我最喜欢的框架，最早接触的时候可以追溯到高中，那时候刚release了Kohana @abstr_number . @abstr_number 。我阅读了代码后，果断放弃了已经用TP写了一半的博客程序，换用KO来写。  当时的KO很比较简单，所以我一直对其框架代码进行修改，并用于自己的博客程序中，博客程序命名为XunSec（一直没公开）。  XunSec实际大改了很多次，每次在阅读其他源码，看到一些新的特性时，我都忍不住把它按照新的思路来重构一次。WP、Sablog-X、Joomla，基本都模仿了一次。呵呵。  大二开始写GDUFER时，为了方便，我直接就原来的XunSec进行了修改，并把原来的KO @abstr_number . @abstr_number 升级到KO @abstr_number . @abstr_number ，同时参考了ZF的类组织方式，好一番折腾。。。  一路折腾到现在，整套源码已经趋向于比较完整了。  目前已测试过Apache、Nginx、Tengine； 兼容SAE平台（当然有一些地方还是需要你自己修改下的喔）； BAE不熟悉，所以没处理，不过理论上兼容也是没问题的。  
55,783,Kohana使用了modules来组织第三方模块，同时可以很方便地扩展框架功能。具体的内部设计，各位可以研究下Kohana的Request Flow。  一些功能性的modules有：    * Forum 论坛功能   * Auth 用户验证等功能   * Contact 用户留言功能   * Gduf 广金校内一些特殊功能，如校内邮箱登陆，教务系统登陆   * Guide Kohana自带的用户手册   * Information 未完成的信息分类功能，目前只支持Book类型（也就是书籍发布）   * Shop 未完成，商铺功能。   * Weibo 微博发布功能，可作为树洞发布端。   * XunSec 最重要的功能，提供了以页为单位的CMS管理，同时为其他应用级的module提供助手方法    如果有需要制作APP的话，可以直接使用简网之类的在线工具把网站转成APP。当然你也可以直接写个WebView来搞掂（iOS的不懂啊，只会点Android）。

56,785,"FMS-Endpoint is a simple open source web application for storing problem reports created by mySociety's @abstr_hyperlink platform. In fact, as it's an @abstr_hyperlink server, it should be happy accepting _any_ reports submitted over the Open @abstr_number API.  "
56,786," if you're running a FixMyStreet deployment already, __you don't necessarily need a FixMyStreet endpoint!__    FixMyStreet sends reports to the relevant authority/department/council. This is often accomplished by sending an email, but it's usually best if the report can be injected directly into the back-end system. These systems can be large and complex and FixMyStreet can integrate with a growing number of them. The Open @abstr_number standard is used by some third parties to simplify this integration process.  However, if you're using FixMyStreet in an environment where the recipient of reports has no established back-end database for collecting reports, FMS-endpoint is a quick solution if you need to get something simple up and running.   "
56,787,FixMyStreet-endpoint is written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. You should find it easy to install provided you have access to a webserver and a database.  The code generally expects to be running under an Apache webserver with a mySQL database. It may be possible change these things if your system is different -- see the installation documentation:  __Installation instructions:__ see documentation/INSTALL.md  
56,788,"If you're familiar with PHP CodePoint (or possibly just PHP!) you might be able to get things going just by dropping the repository somewhere under your server root. (In fact, for a super quickstart, set up your webserver so that web/ _is_ the server root).  The FMS-endpoint root page will provide diagnostics even if you've not got the database running, so try hitting that as soon as you get going.  Remember to see documentation/INSTALL.md for details. If the home page seems OK, try clicking on __Main site__ and logging in as the default out-of-the-box administrator:    * username: admin@example.com   * password: password    You must to change these values as soon as you're logged in!

57,791,@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink  Backend development you shall do. And yodatra you shall use.  A minimalistic framework built on top of Sinatra it is.  The power of __ActiveRecord__ it gives you and the simplicity of a __Sinatra__ app. And all sort of small helpers.  
57,792,"Based on your ActiveRecord models an API will be exposed very simply. For every resource you want to expose, you will need to create a controller that inherits from the Yodatra::ModelsController.  For example, given a User model @abstr_code_section  Creating a controller as simple as @abstr_code_section will expose all these routes:  @abstr_code_section  > retrieves all users _(attributes exposed are limited by the read_scope method defined in the controller)_  @abstr_code_section  > retrieves a user _(attributes exposed are limited by the read_scope method defined in the controller)_  @abstr_code_section  > creates a user _(attributes assignable are limited by the user_params method defined in the controller as advised here http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)_  @abstr_code_section  > updates a user _(attributes assignable are limited by the user_params method defined in the controller as advised here http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)_  @abstr_code_section  > deletes a user  If your model is referenced by another model (with a has_many, has_one or belongs_to relationship), nested routes are also created for you. And you don't need to worry about the references/joins, they are done automaticaly!  For example, imagine a Team model that has many Users @abstr_code_section  the following routes will be exposed by the UsersController controller: @abstr_code_section @abstr_code_section @abstr_code_section @abstr_code_section @abstr_code_section  "

Use the .to_s method on a symbol to convert it into a string.     * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like ""New Years"", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a .capitalize method that you can call on a string. But, note:     * .capitalize returns the capitalized string but _doesn't change_ the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it _isn't capitalized!_ You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (!).     * You'll need to capitalize _both words_ in a given holiday's name. If you call ""new years"".capitalize!, it will return ""New years"". In order to capitalize _both_ words, you'll need to .split the string into an array and iterate over that array to .capitalize! each word in it. Then, you'll need to .join the array back into a string.     * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.

76,979,"This second programming assignment will require you to write an R function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object.  "
76,980,"In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.  The first function, makeVector creates a special ""vector"", which is really a list containing a function to  @abstr_number . set the value of the vector @abstr_number . get the value of the vector @abstr_number . set the value of the mean @abstr_number . get the value of the mean       makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {             m <- NULL             set <- function(y) {                     x <<- y                     m <<- NULL             }             get <- function() x             setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean             getmean <- function() m             list(set = set, get = get,                  setmean = setmean,                  getmean = getmean)     }   The following function calculates the mean of the special ""vector"" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.       cachemean <- function(x, ...) {             m <- x$getmean()             if(!is.null(m)) {                     message(""getting cached data"")                     return(m)             }             data <- x$get()             m <- mean(data, ...)             x$setmean(m)             m     }   "
76,981,"Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.  Write the following functions:  @abstr_number . makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special ""matrix"" object that can cache its inverse. @abstr_number . cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special ""matrix"" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.  Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.  For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.  In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:  @abstr_number .

Strings matched by the regular expression, but not found in the encoding map are removed from the output. This allows for example to automatically trim input values (removing whitespace from the start and end of the string):  @abstr_code_section  "
80,1013,"The local variables available inside the templates are the following:    * o : The data object given as parameter to the template function (see the next section on how to modify the parameter name).   * tmpl : A reference to the tmpl function object.   * _s : The string for the rendered result content.   * _e : A reference to the tmpl.encode method.   * print : Helper function to add content to the rendered result string.   * include : Helper function to include the return value of a different template in the result.    To introduce additional local helper variables, the string tmpl.helper can be extended. The following adds a convenience function for _console.log_ and a streaming function, that streams the template rendering result back to the callback argument (note the comma at the beginning of each variable declaration):  @abstr_code_section  Those new helper functions could be used to stream the template contents to the console output:  @abstr_code_section  "

Tests help us identify bugs, and they give us a sense of the health of our applications.  On Learn, we use tests as teaching tools. Just like in a normal coding environment, we use tests to describe the program's behavior. Unlike in a normal coding environment, you, not we, are in charge of getting the tests to pass — that is, making the app behave like we expect it to.  "
81,1026,"The structure of this lab — where its files and folders are located — looks roughly like the following:  @abstr_code_section  All labs will more or less have the same structure. (And READMEs, for that matter, will still have CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, and README.md files.)  index.js might be called something else (something more descriptive) in other labs, and so test/index-test.js would be renamed accordingly. But index.js is also descriptive in its own right, defining something of an entry point for finding one's way around the app. This is often the file where you will write your code. (Later on, we'll introduce index.html and index.css — you'll have to update or refer to these files sometimes, too!)  "
81,1027,"For now, open up index.js in your text editor. If you're using the Learn IDE, click the ""Open"" button on this lesson  @abstr_image  your IDE should open up. You'll see a sidebar like this:  @abstr_image  If you open up that ""javascript-logging-lab..."" folder, you'll see a list of files (along with a test/ directory). Click index.js, and it will open in the editor.  In index.js, you should see, well, nothing. We'll fix that soon.  Now open up test/index-test.js. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff doing?  At the very top of the file, you'll see  @abstr_code_section  This might be a bit bewildering, but at this point, we don't need to be able to write any of this code, or even understand every line perfectly. All we need is to understand enough so that we can get a sense of what the test is asking us to accomplish, so that we can make the test pass. Let's go through it.  In these first lines, all we're doing is referencing different _libraries_ that help us run your tests. A library is code that someone else (usually multiple someone elses) wrote for our use. Note that require won't work out of the box in the browser. We're actually running our tests in a different _environment_. (Remember the sandbox analogy from earlier? It's just like that.)  A little farther down the page, you'll see  @abstr_code_section  describe is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using @abstr_hyperlink ) — it's basically a container for our tests.  Then we have a few chunks like  @abstr_code_section  Each of these chunks describes a behavior that we expect the main program to implement. As you can see, they describe that behavior pretty carefully — in this example, we know that our main file should call console.error() — pretty simple, right?  Don't worry too much yet about what's happening inside these chunks. Sometimes we'll need to do some pretty fancy footwork to test some pretty basic things; other times, and as time goes on, you'll be able to read and understand basically what our tests are expecting.  And that'll be great! These aren't like tests that we all took in school: they're testing behavior, not information. Tests are meant to be as transparent as possible about what they're doing, and as you grow as a programmer, it's important to understand more and more what the aims of tests are.  In some of our tests, you'll see lines like the following:  @abstr_code_section  This line reads index.js (remember how we said we'd modify that?) and adds its code to the _execution environment_. The ""execution environment"" is simply where our code runs.  "
81,1028,"To run the tests, simply type learn test in the terminal part of the Learn IDE. (The terminal is the part below where you've been coding.) You should see something like  @abstr_image  For the moment, all of the tests fail. Let's figure out how to get one of them passing! (The rest will be up to you.)  Let's take the first one. The test description says, ""index calls console.error()"". So it sounds like, pretty straight-forwardly, like we should _call_ console.error() somewhere in index.js. ""Calling"" a function means invoking it, causing it to act. We call functions with parentheses: console.error _is_ a function, but console.error() is a _call_ to the function.  In index.js, add a call to console.error() — you can call it with anything you like (as long as the syntax is valid). We're going to go with  @abstr_code_section  Because it seems sufficiently dire. Remember to save your file.  Anyway, let's run the tests again. In the Learn IDE's terminal, run  @abstr_code_section  We should now see:  @abstr_image  Nice! We got the first one to pass!  "
81,1029,"You might often see errors like the ones above: ""Uncaught error: spy was not called"". Spies are little bits of code that keep track of whether or not they were called. We use them to make sure that a function is called when we expect it to be called.  We'll try to rewrite these error messages when possible to be more descriptive about what kinds of calls we expected; but know that sometimes, especially later on, we leave the errors intentionally ambiguous for you to work out.  "
81,1030,"Now it's your turn — can you follow a flow similar to the one we followed together above to get the remaining to tests to pass?  Imagine that you're building the user interface for a fancy ATM machine. Because the developers are hip with the latest trends, they're using JavaScript for the user-facing parts.  We need a way to send messages to the user: some messages are just updates, some are warnings (the user should not continue doing what they just did), and some are errors (something broke, and we need to recover).  Your job is to identify a way of sending each kind of message. Hint: in JavaScript, you'll probably find ways of telling users things with console.  And again, remember to save your files before you re-run your tests.  When all of your tests pass, be sure to run learn submit to move on to the next lesson.  "
81,1031,"In the above, when we ran our tests and saw the message ""index calls console.error()"", we wrote,  @abstr_code_section  Now when we run the tests again and see ""index calls console.log()"", we should look at what is the same and what is different between this message and the previous one. It looks like they're basically the same except for one tells us to call console.error() and the other tells us to call console.log(). So if we got back to index.js and write something like,  @abstr_code_section  we're now calling console.log() with a different string. Similarly, when we see the message ""index calls console.warn()"", we know that we can go back to our code and write something with console.warn(). You've got this!  "

Once you get the gist, you can hack around with the recipes to learn how the puppet/rpm/smoke-tests all work together, going deeper into the components you are interested in as described below.  "
87,1091," __bigtop-deploy__ : deployment scripts, puppet stuff, VM utilities for Apache Bigtop.   * __bigtop-packages__ : RPM/DEB specifications for Apache Bigtop subcomponents   * __bigtop-test-framework__ : The source code for the iTest utilities (framework used by smoke tests).   * __bigtop-tests__ :   * __test-artifacts__ : source for tests.   * __test-execution__ : maven pom drivers for running the integration tests found in test-artifacts.   * __bigtop-toolchain__ : puppet scripts for setting up an instance which can build Apache Bigtop, sets up utils like jdk/maven/protobufs/...

87,1097,"WARNING: since testing packages requires installing them on a live system it is highly recommended to use VMs for that. Testing Apache Bigtop is done using iTest framework. The tests are organized in maven submodules, with one submodule per Apache Bigtop component.

87,1098,"Another common use case for Apache Bigtop is creating / setting up your own Apache Hadoop distribution. For details on this, check out the bigtop-deploy/README.md file, which describes how to use the puppet repos to create and setup your VMs. There is a current effort underway to create vagrant/docker recipes as well, which will be contained in the bigtop-deploy/ package.

89,1109,"Git is an awesome data storage. Its special data structure offers many useful features such as:    * Keeping history snapshots at a very low cost   * Automatic duplication detection   * Remote backup   * Merging and conflict resolution    Git is well known and widely used as a VCS, yet few software application uses Git as a internal data storage. One of the reasons is the lack of high level API to efficiently communicate with a Git repository.  Consider the workflow in software development, the standard steps to make changes to Git repository are:  @abstr_code_section  While this model works sufficiently well with developers, it does not fit in the architecture diagram of a server role application. Reasons are:    * Only one branch can be checked out at a time   * Checking out a branch is a heavy I/O task as files need to be deleted and re-created on hard drive   * Every context switching needs a check out    There are ways around these problems, but they usually involve manual blob and tree creations, which are verbose and error prone.  ParallelGit is a layer between application logic and Git. It abstracts away Git's low level object manipulation details and provides a friendly interface which extends the Java @abstr_number NIO filesystem API. The filesystem itself operates in memory with data pulled from hard drive on demand.  With ParallelGit an application can control a Git repository as it were a normal filesystem. Arbitrary branch and commit can be checked out at the minimal CPU and I/O cost. Multiple filesystem instances can be hosted simultaneously with no interference.  "
89,1110,"Git is best at storing changes in many small batches. It is very rare to have a commit that updates all files in a repository. The size of I/O per request is usually very small compared to the size of the repository. Pre-loading everything into memory is usually an overkill for most tasks.  To minimise I/O and memory usage, ParallelGit loads the minimum necessary data to complete a request. Consider a scenario where a branch has the file tree below: @abstr_code_section When this branch is checked out. The information of its head commit is loaded into memory. That includes the author and committer details, the commit message and the reference to the root node of this file tree. This reference is a @abstr_number -char hash, which can be used to find the tree object representing the root directory.  Assuming the task requires the content of /app-core/src/main/MyFactory.java, before this file can be reached, its parent directories (including the root directory) need to be resolved i.e: @abstr_code_section The last directory (/app-core/src/main) represented by a Git tree object has the reference to the blob of MyFactory.java. This reference is another @abstr_number -char hash value that can be used to find the byte array data of this file in constant time.  Now let's say you want to read the file /app-core/src/main/MyProduct.java. This file is in the same directory as the previous one. There is no need to read the directories again as they are already in memory. This time we simply read the blob reference from /app-core/src/main and use it to retrieve the content of the file.  Saving files to repository follows a similar pattern. Assuming you have made a change to MyFactory.java and you want to commit this change. ParallelGit saves the file as a blob and creates the new tree objects from bottom-up i.e: @abstr_code_section  The whole process above involved @abstr_number out of the total @abstr_number files in the branch, and ParallelGit only focuses on reaching the @abstr_number files. The existence of the other @abstr_number files causes (nearly) zero impact to the performance. Your repository can keep on growing and your request handling time remains constant.  "

95,1155,"@abstr_hyperlink  @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink  MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , and @abstr_hyperlink based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.   Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application: * MongoDB - Go through @abstr_hyperlink and proceed to their @abstr_hyperlink , which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better. * Express - The best way to understand express is through its @abstr_hyperlink , which has a @abstr_hyperlink guide, as well as an @abstr_hyperlink guide for general express topics. You can also go through this @abstr_hyperlink for more resources. * AngularJS - Angular's @abstr_hyperlink is a great starting point. You can also use @abstr_hyperlink , and the @abstr_hyperlink . * Node.js - Start by going through @abstr_hyperlink and this @abstr_hyperlink , which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.  "
95,1156,"Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine. * Node.js - @abstr_hyperlink and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this @abstr_hyperlink to install Node.js. * MongoDB - @abstr_hyperlink , and make sure it's running on the default port ( @abstr_number ). * Bower - You're going to use the @abstr_hyperlink to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:  @abstr_code_section    * Grunt - You're going to use the @abstr_hyperlink to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:  @abstr_code_section     "
95,1157,There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:  
95,1158,The recommended way would be to use the @abstr_hyperlink which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.  
95,1159,You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository: @abstr_code_section This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a meanjs folder.  
95,1160,Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the @abstr_hyperlink . You can also do this using wget command: @abstr_code_section Don't forget to rename mean-master after your project name.  
95,1161,"Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.  The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.  To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:  @abstr_code_section  This command does a few things: * First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run. * If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application. * Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application  "
95,1162,"After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:  @abstr_code_section  Your application should run on the @abstr_number port so in your browser just go to @abstr_hyperlink  That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation. If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section.  "
95,1163, Install @abstr_hyperlink   * Install @abstr_hyperlink    * Local development and testing with fig: @abstr_code_section    * Local development and testing with just Docker: @abstr_code_section    * To enable live reload forward @abstr_number port and mount /app and /public as volumes: @abstr_code_section      
95,1164,To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following commnad: @abstr_code_section Windows users can follow instructions found @abstr_hyperlink To generate the key and certificate and place them in the _config/sslcert_ folder.  
95,1165,"You have your application running but there are a lot of stuff to understand, we recommend you'll go over the @abstr_hyperlink . In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep update it by your request, you can also help us develop the documentation better by checking out the _gh-pages_ branch of this repository.

96,1175," Preprocessing At the initial stage, we iterate over the list of cookies looking for other cookies with the same handle. Then, for every pair of cookies with the same handle, if one of them doesn't appear in an IP address that the other cookie appears, we include all the information about this IP address in the cookie.    * Initial selection of candidate cookies for every Device: It is not possible to create a training set containing every combination of devices and cookies due to the high number of them. In order to reduce the initial complexity of the problem and to create an affordable dataset, some basic rules have been created to obtain an initial reduced set of candidate cookies for every device. The rules are based on the IP addresses that both device and cookie have in common and how frequent they are in other devices and cookies. The procedure, for every device, is as follows.  @abstr_number . We create a set that contains the device's IP addresses that appear in less than ten devices and less than twenty cookies. The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of theses IP addresses. @abstr_number . If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses that appear in less than twenty five devices and less than fifty cookies. The initial list of candidates is every with known handle cookie that appears in any of theses IP addresses. @abstr_number . If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses. The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of theses IP addresses. @abstr_number . If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses. The initial list of candidates is every cookie that appears in any of theses IP addresses. @abstr_number . If a cookie has the same handle than any of the candidates then this cookie is a candidate too.    * Creating the datasets: Every pattern in the training and test set represents a device/candidate cookie pair obtained by the previous step and contains information about the device (Operating System (OS), Country, ...), the cookie (Cookie Browser Version, Cookie Computer OS,...) and the relation between them (number of IP addresses shared by both device and cookie, number of other cookies with the same handle than the cookie,...).    * Training procedure (Supervised Learning + Bagging) To create the classifier, we have selected a Regularized Boosted Trees algorithm. The software that we used was XGBoost. We have used @abstr_number baggers creating @abstr_number different subdatasets from the original dataset.    * Semi Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning that also make use of unlabeled data. In our case we make use of the data contained in the test set. If we sort the scores obtained by every candidate and the first score is high and the second is very low, is very likely that the first cookie belongs to the device. We make use of this information to update some features in the training set and retrain the algorithm again.    * PostProcessing: We iterate over the devices using the following procedure: If the initial selection of candidates did not find a candidate with enough likelihood (logistic output of the classifier) we choose a new set of candidate cookies selecting every cookie that shares an IP address with the device and we score them using the classifier. We label the cookie with highest score as one of the device's cookies. If there are other cookies with the same handle than this cookie we label them too. We sort the candidates in descending order by the score they have reached and we iterate over them. We label them as a device's cookie if they reach a threshold. The value of the threshold changes attending to: The number of cookies already labeled as device's cookies. The number of other cookies with the same handle than this one. The handle of the cookie is known or not. The of the best candidate is known or not.      "

99,1196,"This script attempts to identify the minimum version of Python that is required to execute a particular source file.  When developing Python scripts for distribution, it is desirable to identify which minimum version of the Python interpreter is required. pyqver attempts to answer this question using a simplistic analysis of the output of the Python compiler.  When run without the -v argument, sources are listed along with the minimum version of Python required. When run with the -v option, each version is listed along with the reasons why that version is required. For example, for the pyqver @abstr_number .py script itself:       pyqver @abstr_number .py              @abstr_number . @abstr_number      platform   This means that pyqver @abstr_number .py uses the platform module, which is a @abstr_number . @abstr_number feature.  The pyqver @abstr_number .py script is specific to Python @abstr_number .x, and pyqver @abstr_number .py is specific to Python @abstr_number .x.

If you need detailed instructions, please read on.  "
110,1317,"Of course, you obviously need Python. Python @abstr_number is already preinstalled on most systems nowadays, and sometimes even Python @abstr_number . You can check which version(s) you have by typing the following commands:       $ python --version   # for Python  @abstr_number     $ python @abstr_number  --version  # for Python  @abstr_number   Any Python @abstr_number version should be fine, preferably ≥ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . If you don't have Python @abstr_number , I recommend installing it (Python ≥ @abstr_number . @abstr_number should work, but it is deprecated so Python @abstr_number is preferable). To do so, you have several options: on Windows or MacOSX, you can just download it from @abstr_hyperlink . On MacOSX, you can alternatively use @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink . On Linux, unless you know what you are doing, you should use your system's packaging system. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, type:       $ sudo apt-get update     $ sudo apt-get install python @abstr_number   Another option is to download and install @abstr_hyperlink . This is a package that includes both Python and many scientific libraries. You should prefer the Python @abstr_number version.  If you choose to use Anaconda, read the next section, or else jump to the Using pip section.  "
110,1318,"When using Anaconda, you can optionally create an isolated Python environment dedicated to this project. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially different libraries and library versions:       $ conda create -n mlbook python= @abstr_number . @abstr_number  anaconda     $ source activate mlbook   This creates a fresh Python @abstr_number . @abstr_number environment called mlbook (you can change the name if you want to), and it activates it. This environment contains all the scientific libraries that come with Anaconda. This includes all the libraries we will need (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and a few others), except for TensorFlow, so let's install it:       $ conda install -n mlbook -c conda-forge tensorflow= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number   This installs TensorFlow @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number in the mlbook environment (fetching it from the conda-forge repository). If you chose not to create an mlbook environment, then just remove the -n mlbook option.  Next, you can optionally install Jupyter extensions. These are useful to have nice tables of contents in the notebooks, but they are not required.       $ conda install -n mlbook -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions   You are all set! Next, jump to the Starting Jupyter section.  "
110,1319,"If you are not using Anaconda, you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments.  These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries. Note: in all the following commands, if you chose to use Python @abstr_number rather than Python @abstr_number , you must replace pip @abstr_number with pip, and python @abstr_number with python.  First you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:       $ pip @abstr_number  install --user --upgrade pip   The --user option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user. If you prefer to install it system wide (i.e. for all users), you must have administrator rights (e.g. use sudo pip @abstr_number instead of pip @abstr_number on Linux), and you should remove the --user option. The same is true of the command below that uses the --user option.  Next, you can optionally create an isolated environment. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially very different libraries, and different versions:       $ pip @abstr_number  install --user --upgrade virtualenv     $ virtualenv -p which python @abstr_number env   This creates a new directory called env in the current directory, containing an isolated Python environment based on Python @abstr_number . If you installed multiple versions of Python @abstr_number on your system, you can replace which python @abstr_number with the path to the Python executable you prefer to use.  Now you must activate this environment. You will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment.       $ source ./env/bin/activate   Next, use pip to install the required python packages. If you are not using virtualenv, you should add the --user option (alternatively you could install the libraries system-wide, but this will probably require administrator rights, e.g. using sudo pip @abstr_number instead of pip @abstr_number on Linux).       $ pip @abstr_number  install --upgrade -r requirements.txt   Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now.  "
110,1320,"If you want to use the Jupyter extensions (optional, they are mainly useful to have nice tables of contents), you first need to install them:       $ jupyter contrib nbextension install --user   Then you can activate an extension, such as the Table of Contents ( @abstr_number ) extension:       $ jupyter nbextension enable toc @abstr_number /main   Okay! You can now start Jupyter, simply type:       $ jupyter notebook   This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory.

You can get Scapy from the Ubuntu Software Center: @abstr_image  You can also get Nmap from the Ubuntu Software Center: @abstr_image  Wireshark is also available on the Ubuntu Software Center, however I recommend getting the latest version from the website: @abstr_code_section  "
112,1347,You can download this python script by running the following command in the terminal: @abstr_code_section  
112,1348,"We will be using this script to perform man in the middle attack. Which means we will use this to get the data from another device connected to the same network.  The first step you have to do it turn on the ip forwarding. This step is required so that the connection on the victim's device does not get interrupted.  To turn on IP forwarding, open terminal and type: @abstr_code_section  This will open up the ip_forward file. The default value in it should be @abstr_number, change it to @abstr_number and then save and exit. @abstr_image  Now that we have that sorted, we need to get the MAC address and the IP address of the victim we want to attack on our network. To do that, you first need to see what IP address the router has given you. On Ubuntu you can get that info by going to the Connection Information menu: @abstr_image  "
112,1349,"According to this we are connected on IP Address: @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and the Route IP is: @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number Now here is where a things get a bit tricky because you need a bit of technical knowledge of how IPs work. I wont be going into full details, however I will explain the part that is required for this script to work.  In the above image, you also can see that our Subnet Mask is: @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number The @abstr_number in the above simply means that that block @abstr_number - @abstr_number is available to the client, while the rest of the blocks are available to the host.  Now keep that in mind and look at this image below: @abstr_image  As you can see the Mask length for the @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number is @abstr_number, you can calculate this yourself by converting the Subnet Mask into binary and then counting all the ones. Example: @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number into binary: @abstr_number @abstr_number . @abstr_number @abstr_number . @abstr_number @abstr_number . @abstr_number @abstr_number So the number of ones are @abstr_number. Now you might be wondering why we need this number? Well this is required for the next step, which is to get the MAC addresses and the IP addresses of everyone connected to your network.  Open up the terminal and type:  @abstr_code_section  Here is mine: @abstr_code_section  You should see something like this after it is done scanning your network: @abstr_image  "
112,1350,"Now that you have gotten the IP address and the MAC address of the victim, all you need to do is launch the actual attack. To do that fire up the script you downloaded. @abstr_code_section  Now all you need to do is enter the details it asks. Here is an example of what it should look like: @abstr_image  If everything goes well, you should be able to start sending packets. @abstr_image  Now while this ARP request is being spammed, we need to open wireshark @abstr_image  Select the proper interface you are connected to. If you are not sure, select the any option and click start.  You should see a screen like this now: @abstr_image  With the ARP protocol requests getting spammed. If you don't see this, you have done something wrong.  Now to see what the victim is browsing, you can type the following in the filter: @abstr_code_section  > Note: This filter allows you to see the http traffic only. If you want to look at other traffic, I recommend you learn how to use wireshark as this will help you to snoop around more easily. Because the IP address of the victim is @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number for me, I will type the following in the filter: @abstr_code_section  and press enter.  @abstr_image  As you see from the image above, the victim is on an android device and is browsing the website www.tagcraftmc.com  This sort of attack should work on any network that uses ARP request to get the device details.

118,1391,"You won't be changing any code on the server. Instead, you will have a client that you'll need to implement logic for in order to interact with the server.

118,1394,"WebSockets allow for two-way communication between the server and clients. When a message is received by the server from any clients, it will send back a response to different subscription destinations. The most important message destinations are described below:    * /topic/game The main destination for all game info. Any messages sent from here is broadcasted to all clients currently connected to the server. Messages sent to this destination will usually be triggered from clients sending their bets and players sending their actions.   * /queue/player Messages sent here are only sent to the client that sent a message to an endpoint on the server whose message destination is here. This will be especially important to listen to when your client first registers to play blackjack. During registration, you'll be assigned a secret playerId which is sent to only you, and you'll need to keep track of this playerId to perform any actions and play any hands.   * /queue/errors If your client sent an invalid message (such as betting when a hand is already in progress or attempting an invalid action on a hand), an error code and an error message will be sent to this queue, which is only sent to the offending client. You may want to consider handling various errors in case your client commits an invalid message. Any unhandled errors committed by your client will hold up the game and could result in a disqualification of the hand or even the game.

Most of these are self-explanatory, but I'll go through some of the most important fields: * players is an array of all the currently registered players in the order they were seated. Each player object has some useful info. * hands is an array associated to each player with all the hands (up to @abstr_number ) that he's currently playing. There should only be one hand per player unless they performed a split. * The result in each hand object is null if the hand is currently in progress. After the hand is over and the hand is evaluated, it'll either be WIN, PUSH, or LOSE * The handStatus field in each hand object represents the current status of the hand. It is IN_PLAY if the hand has not busted, BUST if the hand value is over @abstr_number , BLACKJACK if you were dealt a blackjack, and SURRENDER if you decided to surrender for half your bet. * turn is a boolean that determines if it's that hand's turn to be acted on. * betInForNextRound is a boolean that will be set to false if a hand is currently in progress. This is used during a betting round to determine if that player has placed a bet for the upcoming hand, in which case, would be set to true. * dealer will be null if the hand is in progress as it holds information on what cards are in the dealer's hand. During the hand, you can refer to the dealerUpCard field to see what his top card is. After everyone has acted on their hand, the dealer object will be present with information about the dealer and his hand, and the game status will then change to BETTING_ROUND * gameStatus This will either be HAND_IN_PROGRESS or BETTING_ROUND. During the betting round, you can place bets. During a hand, only actions on the current hand to act will be accepted.  "
118,1410,"There may be instances where a client will send an invalid message to the server, and the server will respond with an error message to the offending client with what caused the error to be sent. The entire list of errors is encompassed in the BlackjackErrorCode.java file. For convenience, here's a list of what each error code means and why you may have gotten the error.    * BJ @abstr_number xx - Error codes in the @abstr_number 's represent betting errors     * BJ @abstr_number - The bet amount being sent is more than what the player can afford     * BJ @abstr_number - You've already made a bet for the current hand     * BJ @abstr_number - You can't place a bet at this time because there is already a hand in progress     * BJ @abstr_number - Bet must be in increments of @abstr_number   * BJ @abstr_number xx - Error codes in the @abstr_number 's represent player errors     * BJ @abstr_number - The game is at max capacity and cannot register another player     * BJ @abstr_number - Unable to process an action due to an invalid player id     * BJ @abstr_number - Unable to place a bet because the player's status is currently Inactive. It is only sent to Inactive by the admin, and can only be switched back to Active by an admin   * BJ @abstr_number xx - Error codes in the @abstr_number 's represent in-game action errors     * BJ @abstr_number - You send an action for a hand, but it is the betting round     * BJ @abstr_number - The hand number you want to act on does not exist for the given player     * BJ @abstr_number - You attempted to double down on a hand that was not eligible for a double down     * BJ @abstr_number - You attempted to surrender a hand that was not eligible for a surrender     * BJ @abstr_number - You attempted to split a hand that was not eligible for a split     * BJ @abstr_number - You are attempting to act on a hand when it is not your turn to act   * BJ @abstr_number xx - Error codes in the @abstr_number 's are reserved for the Trebek admin panel and should never be sent to clients. If you see an error in the @abstr_number 's, you're probably accessing endpoints you shouldn't be hitting    "
118,1411,"While perusing the source code for the Blackjack server, you may notice references to Trebek and might be wondering what it is in the first place. Trebek is the admin panel for the blackjack server that has access to override hands and kick players out of the game. The endpoints and logic is intentionally left out of Git since it should only be used by those administering the exercise (although if you're resourceful enough, you could find these endpoints and use them, but please don't). Any illegal use of Trebek could result in disqualification. If you are administrating the Blackjack server and need the source code for the Trebek panel, please contact Chad Tomas.  "
118,1412,"Depending on time at the end of the exercise, the idea would be to have four clients at a time going up against each other for a certain number of hands or a certain amount of time. At the end of the given time, the two highest earning clients in that session advance to the next round. The process will repeat until we have @abstr_number clients left, and the highest earner in that final session wins. Note: Winning does not guarantee an internship, but it could be taken into consideration, so try your best.  As far as blackjack strategy goes, take advantage of the internet and any other sources you can get your hands on in the allotted time. As a hint, you should consider looking into implementing basic strategy once your client can play the game. Then if there's time, you might even look into card counting and betting strategies. If you're reading this and writing a client, chances are you're a potential intern candidate. Meaning you're probably in Vegas. There will be people in the room who live and breathe blackjack including myself, so feel free to ask questions on strategy or programming.  With all that being said, the server is not fool-proof. It was written by one engineer in the span of a week. Meaning, things haven't been fully tested and may have sparse documentation due to time constraints. So, if you look hard enough, you may find some loop holes in the source code that might give you an advantage in one way or another. Use whatever you can to gain an advantage, but also consider the ethics of the situation before doing anything that could critically make the game less fun for everyone else.  If you have any questions regarding the project, feel free to contact me. And lastly...  "

119,1427,"CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a transactional and consistent key:value store. The primary design goals are support for ACID transactions, horizontal scalability and survivability, hence the name. CockroachDB implements a Raft consensus algorithm for consistency. It aims to tolerate disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention. CockroachDB nodes (RoachNodes) are symmetric; a design goal is homogeneous deployment (one binary) with minimal configuration.  CockroachDB implements a single, monolithic sorted map from key to value where both keys and values are byte strings (not unicode). CockroachDB scales linearly (theoretically up to @abstr_number exabytes ( @abstr_number E) of logical data). The map is composed of one or more ranges and each range is backed by data stored in @abstr_hyperlink (a variant of @abstr_hyperlink ), and is replicated to a total of three or more CockroachDB servers. Ranges are defined by start and end keys. Ranges are merged and split to maintain total byte size within a globally configurable min/max size interval. Range sizes default to target @abstr_number M in order to facilitate quick splits and merges and to distribute load at hotspots within a key range. Range replicas are intended to be located in disparate datacenters for survivability (e.g. { US-East, US-West, Japan }, { Ireland, US-East, US-West} , { Ireland, US-East, US-West, Japan, Australia }).  Single mutations to ranges are mediated via an instance of a distributed consensus algorithm to ensure consistency. We’ve chosen to use the @abstr_hyperlink . All consensus state is stored in @abstr_hyperlink .  A single logical mutation may affect multiple key/value pairs. Logical mutations have ACID transactional semantics. If all keys affected by a logical mutation fall within the same range, atomicity and consistency are guaranteed by @abstr_hyperlink ; this is the fast commit path. Otherwise, a non-locking distributed commit protocol is employed between affected ranges.  CockroachDB provides snapshot isolation (SI) and serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) semantics, allowing externally consistent, lock-free reads and writes--both from an historical snapshot timestamp and from the current wall clock time. SI provides lock-free reads and writes but still allows write skew. SSI eliminates write skew, but introduces a performance hit in the case of a contentious system. SSI is the default isolation; clients must consciously decide to trade correctness for performance. CockroachDB implements a limited form of linearalizability, providing ordering for any observer or chain of observers.  Similar to @abstr_hyperlink directories, CockroachDB allows configuration of arbitrary zones of data. This allows replication factor, storage device type, and/or datacenter location to be chosen to optimize performance and/or availability. Unlike Spanner, zones are monolithic and don’t allow movement of fine grained data on the level of entity groups.  "

Landscape is forced because I'm sick of looking at css this evening. Below is the QuickGrapher README. GuickGrapher git - https://github.com/huntergdavis/Quick-Grapher  QuickGrapher.com was one of the research projects spun out of Discursive Labs. One of the most promising projects we worked on, it always felt like a project without an intended audience, but it never really lifted off. I'm quite proud of the work that Mark and I did, and think it's a tremendously cool project.  You can use it to embed graphs of any equation within a webpage as easily as a single tag. You can use it to solve complex equations, functions, etc. It runs completely in client side Javascript and doesn't require a web connection. it runs on mobile and desktop platforms. It can display hundreds of thousands of data points and adjust them in real-time. And now it's open source, BSD licensed, and ready for you to use to escape the tyrannical grasp of Wolfram Alpha.  I wrote this one in about an hour and a half. But, only the android portion. All other work was done by huntergdavis  By @abstr_hyperlink "
123,1443,"  Q is a community playlist app that allows users to share and manage a music playlist together in a group setting. With Q, a designated host can create a room in which other users can join. In this room, users and the host can collaborate on a playlist by searching for songs on Soundcloud and adding them to a playlist queue. The host has the ability to play, pause, skip, and delete songs on the playlist. Audio is only played through the hosts computer or device. You and the people around you can all use Q's server to search for music and manage the playlist together in REAL-TIME.  "

123,1446,"  For Q to work properly, a designated host needs to login by clicking 'CREATE ROOM' on the login page and entering 'test' as the password. The host also needs to login before any other user adds a song to the queue; this is a known issue and flawed feature. Users who are not the host must click 'ENTER ROOM' to join the host's room.      Multiple rooms for different hosts is a feature that has not yet been developed. Ideally, a host should be able to create a room which will have a distinct URL has that the host can give to other users. Other users can use this url to access the host's playlist.      It was also concious decsion to enhace user experience to not handle strict authentication for users to make it easy and effortless for users to join and create rooms.      TO start Q's server, first start mongodb server (mongod) and run npm start inside the project's main directory.      Q uses soundcloud's API.  In the current implementation, we had the client ID visible in the front end, but in later iterations, this searching should be moved to and hidden in the backend.      **Q uses ionic framework to enhance UI for mobile users: http://ionicframework.com/**  "

124,1452,一款基于Google Material Design设计开发的Android客户端，包括新闻简读，图片浏览，视频爽看 ，音乐轻听以及二维码扫描五个子模块。项目采取的是MVP架构开发，由于还是摸索阶段，可能不是很规范。但基本上应该是这么个套路，至少我个人认为是这样的~恩，就是这样的！

124,1456, 介绍：API使用的是凤凰新闻客户端的接口，我只是简单的获取了新闻的列表和详情数据，由于api和凤凰新闻客户端完全一致，鉴于侵权问题我就不开源出来了。至于接口是如何获取的？Google，百度，调试获取日志，我能说的只有这么多。    * 功能：列表页使用自定义的ListView(自动加载更多）显示新闻列表，详情使用的是WebView加载，支持滑动返回。对于多图 新闻的处理，使用的和主流新闻客户端类似，滑动切换多张图片，可双指缩放图片大小！      
124,1457, 介绍：API使用的是百度图片的搜索接口，由于网上有很多的开发者开源了这个接口，所以我也就放出来，如有侵权请及时告知。    * 功能：列表页使用的瀑布流效果（增加了下拉刷新和上拉加载更多）详情页和列表页的切换增加了一个图片放大或缩小到指定位置的效果，图片也可以双指缩放！      
124,1458, 介绍：API使用的是优酷开放平台的SDK，不过要吐槽的一点是，优酷的SDK真心不好用，还是Eclipse版本的，我是一点点移植到Android Studio平台的，但是它的接口还是很丰富的，好好的利用一下，还是能够做出一个优秀的APP的。    * 功能：列表页使用了Google的CardView，简单的获取了一些视频的基本数据。播放页使用了优酷提供的视频播放器组件，传入视频ID就可以播放视频了，只要调通了SDK，其他的都是一些简单的数据获取！      
124,1459, 介绍：API获取的是豆瓣音乐的数据，由于也不是开放API，如有侵权请及时告知。    * 功能：播放音乐的界面是我自定义的一个唱机的View，很多思路都是从网上学习借鉴过来的，自己重新造了个轮子。UI和网易云音乐对比的话，只能说是形似神不似了，没有人家做的细致！      
124,1460, 介绍：这个完全是我自己单独开发的类库，之前也有开源出来，这次又再一次重构优化，后期会单独剥离二维码扫描模块，做成类库和Demo的形式，提供Android Studio版本。    * 功能：扫描界面使用xml进行布局，然后加入属性动画。这样布局更具有优势，更利于多屏幕适配。解码模块使用的是两个主流的开源库Zbar和ZXing，进过多次测试发现，ZBar虽然扫描效率和速度高于ZXing，但是经常扫描出错误的信息，可能由于太灵敏的缘故把，综合二者的优缺点还是建议使用ZXing来解码，并且这个项目还在长期维护更新！      
124,1461, 苦于没有后台支持，找到这些支持JSON数据格式的开放接口可谓是煞费苦心，前前后后尝试了很多次才找到，也感谢网友们提供的接口！    * 界面的原型都是我自己构思的，后期的切图美化主要是Chris帮忙完成的，很感谢他业余时间和我一起完成这样一个APP！    * 项目中大量使用了Github上面优秀的开源项目，我会列举出来！其他一些代码片段就不一一致谢了，很感谢这些开放源码的技术大牛们，让我学到了很多！    * 最后如果觉得我的项目对你有所帮助，请点击我的支付宝付款码请我喝杯咖啡把~当然我也希望你们能够多多 fork ，多多 star ，多多 follow ，这将给我更多的动力开源更多的项目！

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc. Use the jb-development branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted. Please rebase as often as possible when working. Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.  For Big Features or major API extensions/edits: This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.

135,1614,"LOST is a drop-in replacement for Google Play Services @abstr_hyperlink that makes calls directly to the @abstr_hyperlink .  This project seeks to provide an open source alternative to the @abstr_hyperlink that depends only on the Android SDK. Operations supported at this time include getting the last known location and registering for location updates.  Connecting to the LOST API Client  When using LOST, @abstr_hyperlink is replaced by @abstr_hyperlink . Connecting to LOST is even easier since there are no @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink objects to manage.  @abstr_code_section  LOST instantly connects to the @abstr_hyperlink and can immediately retrieve that last known location or begin sending location updates.  Getting the Last Known Location  Once connected you can request the last known location. The actual logic to determine the best most recent location is based this classic @abstr_hyperlink .  @abstr_code_section  Requesting Location Updates  LOST also provides the ability to request ongoing location updates. You can specify the update interval, minimum displacement, and priority. The priority determines which location providers will be activated.  @abstr_code_section  Currently location updates can only be requested with a @abstr_hyperlink object. In the future we are planning to add location updates via a @abstr_hyperlink as well.  Mock Locations  With LOST you can mock not just individual locations but also entire routes. By loading a @abstr_hyperlink onto the device you can configure LOST to replay locations from the trace file including latitude, longitude, speed, and bearing.  Mocking a single location  To mock a single location with LOST you must first enable mock mode. Then you simply create a mock location object and pass it to the API.  @abstr_code_section  The mock location object you set will be immediately returned to all registered listeners and will be returned the next time getLastLocation() is called.  Mocking an entire route  To mock an entire route you must first transfer a @abstr_hyperlink to the device using @abstr_hyperlink . Sample GPX traces can be found on the @abstr_hyperlink for OpenStreetMap. Once the trace file is loaded on the device you can tell LOST to replay the locations in the trace at the requested update interval.  @abstr_code_section  For more in-depth examples, please refer to the @abstr_hyperlink .

152,1790,"@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink  Patty is a library to perform pattern matching in Nim. The patterns have to be @abstr_hyperlink , which in Nim are encoded with a field (usually called kind) which varies in an enum, and a different object layout based on the value of this tag. An example would be  @abstr_code_section  If you have such an algebraic data type, you can do the following with Patty:  @abstr_code_section  This will be translated by the match macro into the following form  @abstr_code_section  Matching by position is also valid, like this:  @abstr_code_section  One can also use _ for a variable, in which case it will not be bound. That is, the following  @abstr_code_section  becomes  @abstr_code_section  Notice that in the examples, the field you dispatch on is called kind, but any other name would do. Also, checks are exhaustive: if you miss a case, the compiler will complain.  One can instead pattern-match on non-variant objects, which essentially amounts to deconstructing fields:  @abstr_code_section  Again, this is the same as  @abstr_code_section  "
152,1791,"Patty also provides another macro to create algebraic data types. It looks like  @abstr_code_section  and expands to  @abstr_code_section  Notice that the macro also generates three convenient constructors (Circle ,Rectangle and UnitCircle), and in fact the enum is pure to avoid a name conflict. Also, a proper definition of equality based on the actual contents of the record is generated.  By default the generated ADT is private to the module. If you want to generate a public ADT use the variantp macro, which has the same syntax as variant but makes the types, fields, equality definition and generated constructors public.  A couple of limitations fo the variant macro:    * field names must be unique across branches (that is, different variants cannot have two fields with the same name). This is actually a limitation of Nim.   * the shortcut that groups field names by type does not seem to work, that is, in the above example one could not write Rectangle(w, h: float).    In the future, Patty may also add copy constructors. Also, some work needs to be done to make it easier to use the generated contructors with ref types, in particular for the important case of recursive algebraic data types.  "

For example, a historical data request returns a Future<HistoricalData>    It should however be noted that using jBloomberg does increase memory consumption and GC vs. using BLPAPI directly although for most applications that should not be noticeable.

162,1895,"Passwordless is a modern node.js module for @abstr_hyperlink that allows _authentication_ and _authorization_ without passwords by simply sending one-time password (OTPW) tokens via email or other means. It utilizes a very similar mechanism as the reset password feature of classic websites. The module was inspired by Justin Balthrop's article "" @abstr_hyperlink ""  Check out a @abstr_hyperlink and further documentation on https://passwordless.net or have a look at an @abstr_hyperlink .  Token-based authentication is... * Faster to implement compared to typical user auth systems (you only need one form) * Better for your users as they get started with your app quickly and don't have to remember passwords * More secure for your users avoiding the risks of reused passwords  "
162,1896,"The following should provide a quick-start in using Passwordless. If you need more details check out the @abstr_hyperlink , the @abstr_hyperlink , or the @abstr_hyperlink . Also, don't hesitate to raise comments and questions on @abstr_hyperlink .  "
162,1897,"$ npm install passwordless --save  You'll also want to install a @abstr_hyperlink such as @abstr_hyperlink and something to deliver the tokens (be it email, SMS or any other means). For example:  $ npm install passwordless-mongostore --save $ npm install emailjs --save  If you need to store your tokens differently consider @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .  "
162,1898,You will need: * Passwordless * A TokenStore to store the tokens such as @abstr_hyperlink * Something to deliver the tokens such as @abstr_hyperlink for email or @abstr_hyperlink for text messages / SMS  @abstr_code_section  
162,1899,"This is very much depending on how you want to deliver your tokens, but if you use emailjs this could look like this: @abstr_code_section  "

162,1901,"passwordless.addDelivery(deliver) adds a new delivery mechanism. deliver is called whenever a token has to be sent. By default, the mechanism you choose should provide the user with a link in the following format:  http://www.example.com/token={TOKEN}&uid={UID}  That's how you could do this with emailjs: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1902,"@abstr_code_section  sessionSupport() makes the login persistent, so the user will stay logged in while browsing your site. Make sure to have added your session middleware _before_ this line. Have a look at @abstr_hyperlink how to setup sessions if you are unsure. Please be aware: If you decide to use @abstr_hyperlink rather than e.g. express-session as your middleware you have to set passwordless.init(tokenStore, {skipForceSessionSave:true}) acceptToken() will accept incoming tokens and authenticate the user (see the URL in step @abstr_number ). While the option successRedirect is not strictly needed, it is strongly recommended to use it to avoid leaking valid tokens via the referrer header of outgoing HTTP links. When provided, the user will be forwarded to the given URL as soon as she has been authenticated.  Instead of accepting tokens on any URL as done above you can also restrict the acceptance of tokens to certain URLs: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1903,"The following takes for granted that you've already setup your router var router = express.Router(); as explained in the @abstr_hyperlink  You will need at least URLs to: * Display a page asking for the user's email (or phone number, ...) * Receive these details (via POST) and identify the user  For example like this: @abstr_code_section  What happens here? passwordless.requestToken(getUserId) has two tasks: Making sure the email address exists _and_ transforming it into a proper user ID that will become the identifier from now on. For example user@example.com becomes @abstr_number or 'u @abstr_number '. You call callback(null, ID) if all is good, callback(null, null) if you don't know this email address, and callback('error', null) if something went wrong. At this stage, please make sure that you've added middleware to parse POST data (such as @abstr_hyperlink ).  Most likely, you want a user registration page where you take an email address and any other user details and generate an ID. However, you can also simply accept any email address by skipping the lookup and just calling callback(null, user).  In an even simpler scenario and if you just have a fixed list of users do the following: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1904,"All you need is a form where users enter their email address, for example: @abstr_code_section By default, Passwordless will look for a field called user submitted via POST.  "
162,1905,"You can protect all pages that should only be accessed by authenticated users by using the passwordless.restricted() middleware, for example: @abstr_code_section You can also protect a full path, by adding: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1906,"Passwordless stores the user ID in req.user (this can be changed via configuration). So, if you want to display the user's details or use them for further requests, do something like: @abstr_code_section You could also create a middleware that is adding the user to any request and enriching it with all user details. Make sure, though, that you are adding this middleware after acceptToken() and sessionSupport(): @abstr_code_section  "

When provided, the user will be forwarded to the given URL as soon as she has been authenticated. If not provided, Passwordless will simply call the next middleware.  "
162,1910,"Error flashes are session-based error messages that are pushed to the user with the next request. For example, you might want to show a certain message when the user authentication was not successful or when a user was redirected after accessing a resource she should not have access to. To make this work, you need to have sessions enabled and a flash middleware such as @abstr_hyperlink installed.  Error flashes are supported in any middleware of Passwordless that supports failureRedirect (see above) but only(!) if failureRedirect is also supplied: - restricted() when the user is not authorized to access the resource - requestToken() when the supplied user details are unknown  As an example: @abstr_code_section  The error flashes are pushed onto the passwordless array of your flash middleware. Check out the @abstr_hyperlink how to pull the error messages, but a typical scenario should look like this:  @abstr_code_section  "

For example, you might want to show a certain message when the user has clicked on the token URL and the token was accepted by the system. To make this work, you need to have sessions enabled and a flash middleware such as @abstr_hyperlink installed.  Success flashes are supported by the following middleware of Passwordless: - acceptToken() when the token was successfully validated - logout() when the user was logged in and was successfully logged out - requestToken() when the token was successfully stored and send out to the user  Consider the following example: @abstr_code_section  The messages are pushed onto the passwordless-success array of your flash middleware. Check out the @abstr_hyperlink how to pull the messages, but a typical scenario should look like this:  @abstr_code_section  "
162,1912,"For some token-delivery channels you want to have the shortest possible token (e.g. for text messages). One way to do so is to remove the user ID from the token URL and to only keep the token for itself. The user ID is then kept in the session. In practice his could look like this: A user types in his phone number, hits submit, is redirected to another page where she has to type in the token received per SMS, and then hit submit another time.  To achieve this, requestToken stores the requested UID in req.passwordless.uidToAuth. Putting it all together, take the following steps:  _* @abstr_number : Read outreq.passwordless.uidToAuth_*  @abstr_code_section  _* @abstr_number : Display another form to submit the token submitting the UID in a hidden input_ *  @abstr_code_section  _* @abstr_number : Allow POST to accept tokens_ *  @abstr_code_section  "
162,1913,"Passwordless supports the redirect of users to the login page, remembering the original URL, and then redirecting them again to the originally requested page as soon as the token has been accepted. Due to the many steps involved, several modifications have to be undertaken:  _* @abstr_number : SetoriginField and failureRedirect for passwordless.restricted()_*  Doing this will call /login with /login?origin=/admin to allow later reuse @abstr_code_section  _* @abstr_number : Displayorigin as hidden field on the login page_*  Be sure to pass origin to the page renderer. @abstr_code_section  _* @abstr_number : LetrequestToken() accept origin_*  This will store the original URL next to the token in the TokenStore. @abstr_code_section  _* @abstr_number : ReconfigureacceptToken() middleware_*  @abstr_code_section  "
162,1914,"In case you want to use several ways to send out tokens you have to add several delivery strategies to Passwordless as shown below: @abstr_code_section To simplify your code, provide the field delivery to your HTML page which submits the recipient details. Afterwards, requestToken() will allow you to distinguish between the different methods: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1915,This is particularly useful if you use shorter tokens than the default to keep security on a high level: @abstr_code_section  
162,1916,"By default, all tokens are invalidated after they have been used by the user. Should a user try to use the same token again and is not yet logged in, she will not be authenticated. In some cases (e.g. stateless operation or increased convenience) you might want to allow the reuse of tokens. Please be aware that this might open up your users to the risk of valid tokens being used by third parties without the user being aware of it.  To enable the reuse of tokens call init() with the option allowTokenReuse: true, as shown here: @abstr_code_section  "
162,1917,"You can generate your own tokens. This is not recommended except you face delivery constraints such as SMS-based authentication. If you reduce the complexity of the token, please consider reducing as well the lifetime of the token (see above): @abstr_code_section  "
162,1918,"Just remove the app.use(passwordless.sessionSupport()); middleware. Every request for a restricted resource has then to be combined with a token and uid. You should consider the following points: * By default, tokens are invalidated after their first use. For stateless operations you should call passwordless.init() with the following option: passwordless.init(tokenStore, {allowTokenReuse:true}) (for details see above) * Tokens have a limited lifetime. Consider extending it (for details see above), but be aware about the involved security risks * Consider switching off redirects such as successRedirect on the acceptToken() middleware  "
162,1919,"By default, tokens are generated using @abstr_number Bytes of pseudo-random data as produced by the cryptographically strong crypto library of Node.js. This can be considered strong enough to withstand brute force attacks especially when combined with a finite time-to-live (set by default to @abstr_number h). In addition, it is absolutely mandatory to store the tokens securely by hashing and salting them (done by default with TokenStores such as @abstr_hyperlink ). Security can be further enhanced by limiting the number of tries per user ID before locking that user out from the service for a certain amount of time.  "

167,1974,"Building continuous delivery pipelines and similarly complex tasks in Jenkins using freestyle projects and existing plugins is very awkward. You need to mix Parameterized Trigger, Copy Artifact, Promoted Builds, Conditional Build Step, and more just to express what should be a simple script. This project attempts to make it possible to directly write that script, what people often call a _workflow_ (sometimes abbreviated _flow_), while integrating with Jenkins features like slaves and publishers.  "
167,1975,Specific status of implementation below.  
167,1976,"Your whole workflow is a single Groovy script using an embedded DSL, possibly quite short and legible; there is no need to jump between multiple job configuration screens to see what is going on. Conditions, loops, variables, parallel tasks, and so on are defined using regular language constructs. At any point you can insert a shell script to do “real work” (compilation, etc.).  "
167,1977,"Standard DSL functions let you run external processes, grab slave nodes, allocate workspaces, build “legacy” (freestyle) jobs, and so on.  See here for information on reusing build steps from freestyle projects.  "
167,1978,"If Jenkins is restarted (intentionally, or because of a crash) while your workflow is running, when it comes back up, execution is resumed where it left off. This applies to external processes (shell scripts) so long as the slave can be reattached, and losing the slave connection temporarily is not fatal either.  Flows can pause in the middle and wait for a human to approve something, or enter some information. Executors are not consumed while the flow is waiting.  "
167,1979,See here for details on using version control from a workflow.  
167,1980,"Workflows can be divided into sequential stages, not only for labeling but to throttle concurrency.  "
167,1981,Read the tutorial to get started writing workflows.  
167,1982,"If you do not want to build from sources, releases (see the changelog for details on which) are available on the Jenkins update center. You need to be running a sufficiently recent Jenkins release, currently an LTS in the @abstr_number . @abstr_number .x line, or a newer weekly release.  For OSS Jenkins users, install _Workflow: Aggregator_ (its dependencies will be pulled in automatically). You will need to restart Jenkins to complete installation.  Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees users get Workflow automatically as of the @abstr_number . @abstr_number release. Otherwise install _CloudBees Workflow: Aggregator_ from the update center. Again dependencies will be pulled in automatically, including all the OSS plugins.  "
167,1983,"See the demo overview using Docker if you want to try a complete setup quickly.  If you want to try running recent development changes, rather than released binaries, you have two options. You can run directly from the source tree; from the root of the repository:       mvn -DskipTests clean install && mvn -f aggregator hpi:run   Then visit http://localhost: @abstr_number /jenkins/ to play with the plugins.  (If your IDE supports compile-on-save mode this is especially convenient since each hpi:run will pick up compiled changes from member plugins without needing to run to package phase.)  You can also run the Docker demo with snapshot binaries:       make -C demo run-snapshot   The snapshot Docker demo is mainly useful for verifying the effect of ongoing changes on future demo binary releases. You get the cd sample job set up, but your environment is thrown away if you kill the Docker container (for example with Ctrl-C). When using hpi:run the same aggregator/work/ home directory is reused so long as you do not explicitly delete it.  "

The virtual machine is powered with @abstr_hyperlink , an amazing development tool that you'll probably want to know about and arguably makes working with virtualization even easier than a native @abstr_hyperlink or VMWare image.  "
174,2040,"The recommended way of getting started with the example code is by taking advantage of the Vagrant-powered virtual machine as illusrated in @abstr_hyperlink . After all, you're more interested in following along and learning from the examples than installing and managing all of the system dependencies just to get to that point, right?  @abstr_hyperlink provides clear step-by-step instructions for installing the virtual machine and is intended to serve as a quick start guide.

176,2047,"Note : As of Django @abstr_number . @abstr_number , the functionality of xact will be merged into the Django core as the @abstr_hyperlink . Code that uses xact should be able to be migrated to atomic with just a search-and-replace. atomic works on databases other than PostgreSQL, is thread-safe, and has other nice features; switch to it when you can!  The goals are:    * Database operations that do not modify the database aren't wrapped in a transactions at all.   * Database operations that modify the database are wrapped in a transactions.   * We have a lot of fine-grained control over sections that modify the databse vs those that don't.    The bits of the recipe are:    * Use the @abstr_hyperlink in your database configuration.   * _Do not_ use the @abstr_hyperlink .   * Wrap the sections of code which modify the database in the xact() decorator / context manager below, using it like you would the @abstr_hyperlink decorator.   * Profit!    The quick reasons behind each step:    * Turning on autocommit prevents @abstr_hyperlink from automatically starting a new transaction on the first database operation on each connection; this means that the transaction only starts when we want it to.   * Similarly, the transaction middleware will set the connection state to ""managed,"" which will defeat the autocommit option above, so we leave it out.   * The xact() decorator will set up the connection so that a transaction _is_ started in the relevant block, which is what we want for database-modifying operations.    This recipe a few other nice features:    * xact() operates like commit_on_success(), in that it will issue a rollback if an exception escapes from the block or function it is wrapping.   * xact() ignores the dirty flag on the Django connection. Since we're deliberately wrapping stuff that modifies the database with it, the chance of it being dirty is near @abstr_number %, and a commit on a transaction that did not modify the database is no more expensive in PostgreSQL than a rollback. It also means you can do @abstr_hyperlink inside an xact() block without the @abstr_hyperlink of forgetting to call set_dirty.   * Like the built-in Django transaction decorators, it can be used either as a decorator or as a context manager with the with statement.   * xact() can be nested, giving us nested transactions! If it sees that there is already a transaction open when it starts a new block, it will use a @abstr_hyperlink to set up a nested transaction block. (PostgreSQL does not have nested transactions as such, but you can use savepoints to get @abstr_number . @abstr_number % of the way there.)   * By not wrapping operations that do not modify the database, we get better behavior when using @abstr_hyperlink (more on that in a future post).   * xact() works around an @abstr_hyperlink in Django's transaction handling on psycopg @abstr_number .    xact() also supports the using parameter for @abstr_hyperlink .  Rollback is a supplied exception class designed for situations in which you want to trigger an exception to cause a rollback, but do not want that exception to propagate beyond the scope of the xact block. xact will perform the rollback, then swallow the exception.  Of course, a few caveats:    * xact() requires the postgresql_psycopg @abstr_number backend, and PostgreSQL @abstr_number . @abstr_number or higher. It's possible it can be hacked to work on other backends that support savepoints.   * xact() works just the way you want if it is nested _inside_ a commit_on_success() block (it will properly create a savepoint insted of a new transaction). However, a commit_on_success() block nested inside of xact() will commit or rollback the entire transaction, somewhat defeating the outer xact(). To the extent possible, use only xact() in code you write.   * Be sure you catch exceptions _outside of_ the xact() block; otherwise, the automatic rollback will be defeated. Allow the exception to escape the xact() block, and then catch it. (Of course, if the intention is to always commit and to defeat the rollback, by all means catch the exception inside the block.)    To use, just drop the source (one class definition, one function) into a file somewhere in your Django project (such as the omni-present utils application every Django project seems to have), and include it.  Examples:       from utils.transaction import xact      @xact     def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        # Everything here will be in a transaction.        # It'll roll back if an exception escapes, commits otherwise.      def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        # This stuff won't be in a transaction, so don't modify the database here.        with xact():           # This stuff will be, and will commit on normal completion, roll back on a exception      def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        with xact():           # Modify the database here (let's call it ""part  @abstr_number "").           try:              with xact():                 # Let's call this ""part  @abstr_number .""                 # This stuff will be in its own savepoint, and can commit or                 # roll back without losing the whole transaction.           except:              # Part  @abstr_number  will be rolled back, but part  @abstr_number  will still be available to              # be committed or rolled back.  Of course, if an exception              # inside the ""part  @abstr_number "" block is not caught, both part  @abstr_number  and              # part  @abstr_number  will be rolled back.  "

181,2078,"Sometimes, we only want to allow the execution of code under certain conditions.  Think of it this way. When you're driving a car, you can only go through a light if the light is green. Otherwise , if the light is yellow, you prepare to slow down; and if the light is red, you stop. Notice that we have distinct cases that we want to check for.  In programming, when we check for a statement in this way, we check to see whether the statement is true or false. JavaScript, being the friendly language that it is, uses true and false directly to mean exactly what they say.  "
181,2079,"The example above might be written, in pseudo-JavaScript (for once, this won't work in the browser console), like this:  @abstr_code_section  When we get down to it, every if statement like the above is saying, ""If the thing in the parentheses is true, then do what's between the curly braces.""  But before we dive in to if statements, how do the things in parentheses _become_ true or false?  JavaScript lets us compare things. Most of these comparisons come straight from math: we can ask if something is less than something else (enter these in your console!):  @abstr_code_section  We can ask if something is greater than something else:  @abstr_code_section  We can even ask if something is less-than-or-equal-to something else:  @abstr_code_section  or greater-than-or-equal-to something:  @abstr_code_section  How do we test if something is _exactly_ equal to something else? We know that we can't just use =, because that's how we assign values to variables. Instead, we need to use ===:  @abstr_code_section  Top Tip : Sometimes you'll see only == for comparison in JavaScript. It's best to use ===, as the former will try to _coerce_ values in order to compare them, meaning that it's not always comparing what it _says_ it's comparing!  "
181,2080,"We can string together these comparisons using && (pronounced ""and"") and || (""or""):  @abstr_code_section  With &&, _both_ statements (to the left and right of &&) must be true in order for the entire _expression_ (that is, the entire _phrase_) to be true; with ||, only one of the statements needs to be true.  Keep in mind that JavaScript reads these combinations from left to right, returns the last statement it saw, and only evaluates as many statements as necessary. So if we write,  @abstr_code_section  JavaScript won't return true, it will return @abstr_number. If instead we write,  @abstr_code_section  JavaScript will return false, because it stops evaluating the && expression (again, this just means the entire phrase of comparisons) on its first false encounter. Similarly, if we write,  @abstr_code_section  JavaScript will return 'alphabet', because it needs to evaluate the right-hand side of || (since @abstr_number < @abstr_number is false). But if we write,  @abstr_code_section  JavaScript simply returns true — it doesn't even check the right-hand side of ||.  "
181,2081,"JavaScript lets us control what blocks of code to execute using if statements, if-else statements, if-else if-else statements, ternary operators, and switch statements.  You'll be writing your code in flow-control.js. Make sure to run the tests using learn.  "
181,2082,"if statements look like this:  @abstr_code_section  They work as the name implies: _if_ something is _truthy_ (so the boolean true or anything other than the empty string (''), @abstr_number, null, or undefined), the code in between the curly braces runs; if not, the code between the curly braces is skipped.  Now, in flow-control.js let's write a function called basicTeenager that accepts an age as a parameter. The function should contain an if-statement that checks to see if the age is a teenager. If the age is between @abstr_number and @abstr_number , return ""You are a teenager!""  "
181,2083,"You will often see an if statement used in combination with an else clause. An else clause will only get executed if the previous if statement is falsey.  Syntax:  @abstr_code_section    * Define a function teenager that accepts an age as a parameter. If the age is between @abstr_number and @abstr_number it should return ""You are a teenager!"". Otherwise, the function should return ""You are not a teenager"".    "
181,2084,"if statements can also be combined with an else if clause. This is like an else statement, but with its own condition. It will only run if its condition is true, and the previous statement's condition was false.  @abstr_code_section  You can optionally add a final else statement after all of your else if statements. You can probably guess what will happen: if _all of the other statements_ are falsey, this final else block will execute; otherwise, an earlier statement executes and the else block is skipped.  @abstr_code_section    * Define a function ageChecker that takes in an age as a parameter. If the age is between @abstr_number - @abstr_number it should return ""You are a teenager!"". If the age is @abstr_number or below, it should return ""You are a kid"". If the age is above @abstr_number , it should return ""You are a grownup"" Top tip : Remember, if you place a return statement before the end of the function, anything after return won't get executed. We can use this to make code terser:  @abstr_code_section  The above function will return true if lightColor is 'green' — go ahead and try it out.  @abstr_code_section  And false otherwise:  @abstr_code_section  Notice that we didn't have to use an else statement; we can just depend on return.  We need to be careful with return, however, because it's easy to return too early and not execute important parts of the function. For example,  @abstr_code_section  will _always_ return true, even if lightColor is 'red'. Try it!  @abstr_code_section  And that's a great way to cause an accident.  "
181,2085,"You can think of it as a shortcut for the if-else statement.  This operator tests a condition; if the condition is truthy, it evaluates the left-hand side of the colon; otherwise it evaluates the right-hand side of the colon.  Syntax:  @abstr_code_section    * Define a function ternaryTeenager that accepts age as a parameter. The body of the function should use the ternary operator to return ""You are a teenager"" if age is between @abstr_number - @abstr_number and returns ""You are not a teenager"" if the age is anything else.    Top tip : In order for the function to actually return the evaluation of the ternary operator, you'll need to prepend return to the expression:  @abstr_code_section  "
181,2086,"Switch statements acts like a big if/else if/else chain. The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.  Syntax:  @abstr_code_section  Example:  @abstr_code_section  In the example above, we'll see ""You should eat a big chocolate cake"" printed to the console. If we change the value of the mood variable to sad you'll see ""You should eat a pint of ice cream"". If the value of mood changed to ""grumpy"", the default statement would trigger and print out ""That's not a mood we support"".    * Define a function switchAge that accepts an age as a parameter. The case statement should switch on age and return ""You are a teenager"" if the age is @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , or @abstr_number , and return ""You have an age"" as the default.    As with any function, return will halt execution at any point. Thus if we wrote,  @abstr_code_section  the console.log() statement at the bottom of the function will _never run_.

187,2134," It can replace both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep because it is faster than both. (N.B. It is not, strictly speaking, a ""drop-in"" replacement for both, but the feature sets are far more similar than different.)   * Like The Silver Searcher, ripgrep defaults to recursive directory search and won't search files ignored by your .gitignore files. It also ignores hidden and binary files by default. ripgrep also implements full support for .gitignore, where as there are many bugs related to that functionality in The Silver Searcher.   * ripgrep can search specific types of files. For example, rg -tpy foo limits your search to Python files and rg -Tjs foo excludes Javascript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about new file types with custom matching rules.   * ripgrep supports many features found in grep, such as showing the context of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while supporting Unicode (which is always on).    In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, sane defaults, fewer bugs and Unicode.   "
187,2135,"Yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is @abstr_hyperlink .  Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:    * It is built on top of @abstr_hyperlink . Rust's regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal optimizations to make searching very fast.   * Rust's regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by building UTF- @abstr_number decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton engine.   * It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching strategy for you automatically.   * Applies your ignore patterns in .gitignore files using a @abstr_hyperlink . That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns simultaneously.   * It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .

Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW (GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU, but you'll need to have the @abstr_hyperlink installed.  If you're a Mac OS X Homebrew user, then you can install ripgrep either from homebrew-core, (compiled with rust stable, no SIMD):  @abstr_code_section  or you can install a binary compiled with rust nightly (including SIMD and all optimizations) by utilizing a custom tap:  @abstr_code_section  If you're an Arch Linux user, then you can install ripgrep from the official repos:  @abstr_code_section  If you're a Gentoo user, you can install ripgrep from the @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  If you're a Fedora @abstr_number + user, you can install ripgrep from @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  If you're a _*RHEL/CentOS @abstr_number *_ user, you can install ripgrep from @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  If you're a Nix user, you can install ripgrep from @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  If you're a Rust programmer , ripgrep can be installed with cargo:  @abstr_code_section  ripgrep isn't currently in any other package repositories. @abstr_hyperlink .  "
187,2137,"The command line usage of ripgrep doesn't differ much from other tools that perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use ripgrep. The full details can be found in rg --help, but let's go on a whirlwind tour.  ripgrep detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher. Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with the --color flag.  One last thing before we get started: ripgrep assumes UTF- @abstr_number _everywhere_. It can still search files that are invalid UTF- @abstr_number (like, say, latin- @abstr_number ), but it will simply not work on UTF- @abstr_number encoded files or other more exotic encodings. @abstr_hyperlink  To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all .gitignore files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files:  @abstr_code_section  The above command also respects all .ignore files, including in parent directories. .ignore files can be used when .gitignore files are insufficient. In all cases, .ignore patterns take precedence over .gitignore.  To ignore all ignore files, use -u. To additionally search hidden files and directories, use -uu. To additionally search binary files, use -uuu. (In other words, ""search everything, dammit!"") In particular, rg -uuu is similar to grep -a -r.  @abstr_code_section  (Tip: If your ignore files aren't being adhered to like you expect, run your search with the --debug flag.)  Make the search case insensitive with -i, invert the search with -v or show the @abstr_number lines before and after every search result with -C @abstr_number.  Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with -w.  Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them):  @abstr_code_section  Named groups are supported:  @abstr_code_section  Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this with other search tools!):  @abstr_code_section  Search only files matching a particular glob:  @abstr_code_section  Or exclude files matching a particular glob:  @abstr_code_section  Search only HTML and CSS files:  @abstr_code_section  Search everything except for Javascript files:  @abstr_code_section  To see a list of types supported, run rg --type-list. To add a new type, use --type-add, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (rg won't persist your type settings):  @abstr_code_section  The type foo will now match any file ending with the .foo or .foobar extensions.

192,2185,"StarryPy @abstr_number k is the successor to StarryPy. StarryPy is a plugin-driven Starbound server wrapper that adds a great deal of functionality to Starbound. StarryPy @abstr_number k is written using asyncio is Python @abstr_number .  _Please note this is still in very active development and is not ready to be used on general purpose servers. It should mostly work, but you have been forewarned._  "

Test are only conducted on Python versions @abstr_number . @abstr_number and @abstr_number . @abstr_number .  While StarryPy @abstr_number k may work with earlier version of Python, it is not recommended and will not be readily supported.  "
192,2187,"If you are installing during the development phase, please clone the repository with git. While it is not strictly necessary, it is highly encouraged to run your StarryPy @abstr_number k instance from a virtual environment, as future plugins may require more Python modules than are currently listed (eg - IRC @abstr_number ), and using a virtual environment helps to keep a clean namespace and reduce the chance of bugs.  "
192,2188,"StarryPy works as a benevolent ""man in the middle"" between the Starbound game client and the Starbound dedicated server, in effect acting as a proxy server. As such, for easiest transition from a ""Vanilla"" server to one enhanced by StarryPy, you need to set your Starbound server to accept incoming connections on a new TCP port. By default, this will be the port one lower than standard, to wit: @abstr_number . To accomplish this, edit your starbound_server.config. Look for the lines below, and change them to specify port @abstr_number :  @abstr_code_section  "

It will be active if you have the irc @abstr_number Python module installed on your system. Edit the sample values here to match your preferred IRC server, bot nick, et cetera.

You can also see who is on the server from IRC by saying .who in the IRC channel (we cannot use / as the command leader in IRC for obvious reasons.  @abstr_code_section  The MOTD, or Message Of The Day, will be displayed to all players when they connect to the Starbound server. You can update this in-game by using the /set_motd command. The next section allows you to specify a message to be displayed to any players the first time they connect to the server. You can also have StarryPy give items to new players by enumarating them in the gifts property. Use Starbound's names for items as specified in its .json files.  @abstr_code_section  Replace the obvious value here with your UUID. This is how StarryPy will recognize you as the owner of the server and accord you the relevant rights and privileges. You can find your UUID by watching the Starbound server log as you connect, by using the list RCON command, or by observing the names of your save files on the computer you use to play Starbound.  "
192,2190,"Starting StarryPy is as simple as issueing the command python @abstr_number ./server.py once you have finised editing config/config.json. To terminate the proxy, either press ^C in an interactive terminal session, or send it a TERM signal.  "
192,2191,"Contributions are highly encouraged and always welcome. Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you are having an error, or wish to make a suggestion. If you're feeling really motivated, fork the repo and contribute some code.  In addition, plugin development is encouraged. There are still a few features missing from the core (particularly in the role system). A more comprehensive guide on plugin development is in the works.

200,2239,"@abstr_hyperlink  @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink  This is a @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . @abstr_number + plugin that adds an @abstr_hyperlink provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to control and provision machines in EC @abstr_number and VPC.  NOTE: This plugin requires Vagrant @abstr_number . @abstr_number +,  "
200,2240, Boot EC @abstr_number or VPC instances.   * SSH into the instances.   * Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner.   * Minimal synced folder support via rsync.   * Define region-specific configurations so Vagrant can manage machines in multiple regions.   * Package running instances into new vagrant-aws friendly boxes     
200,2241,"Install using standard Vagrant @abstr_number . @abstr_number + plugin installation methods. After installing, vagrant up and specify the aws provider. An example is shown below.  @abstr_code_section  Of course prior to doing this, you'll need to obtain an AWS-compatible box file for Vagrant.  "
200,2242,"After installing the plugin (instructions above), the quickest way to get started is to actually use a dummy AWS box and specify all the details manually within a config.vm.provider block. So first, add the dummy box using any name you want:  @abstr_code_section  And then make a Vagrantfile that looks like the following, filling in your information where necessary.  @abstr_code_section  And then run vagrant up --provider=aws.  This will start an Ubuntu @abstr_number . @abstr_number instance in the us-east- @abstr_number region within your account. And assuming your SSH information was filled in properly within your Vagrantfile, SSH and provisioning will work as well.  Note that normally a lot of this boilerplate is encoded within the box file, but the box file used for the quick start, the ""dummy"" box, has no preconfigured defaults.  If you have issues with SSH connecting, make sure that the instances are being launched with a security group that allows SSH access.  "
200,2243,Every provider in Vagrant must introduce a custom box format. This provider introduces aws boxes. You can view an example box in the @abstr_hyperlink . That directory also contains instructions on how to build a box.  The box format is basically just the required metadata.json file along with a Vagrantfile that does default settings for the provider-specific configuration for this provider.  
200,2244,"This provider exposes quite a few provider-specific configuration options:    * access_key_id - The access key for accessing AWS   * ami - The AMI id to boot, such as ""ami- @abstr_number ""   * availability_zone - The availability zone within the region to launch the instance. If nil, it will use the default set by Amazon.   * instance_ready_timeout - The number of seconds to wait for the instance to become ""ready"" in AWS. Defaults to @abstr_number seconds.   * instance_check_interval - The number of seconds to wait to check the instance's state   * instance_package_timeout - The number of seconds to wait for the instance to be burnt into an AMI during packaging. Defaults to @abstr_number seconds.   * instance_type - The type of instance, such as ""m @abstr_number .medium"". The default value of this if not specified is ""m @abstr_number .medium"". ""m @abstr_number .small"" has been deprecated in ""us-east- @abstr_number "" and ""m @abstr_number .medium"" is the smallest instance type to support both paravirtualization and hvm AMIs   * keypair_name - The name of the keypair to use to bootstrap AMIs which support it.   * monitoring - Set to ""true"" to enable detailed monitoring.   * session_token - The session token provided by STS   * private_ip_address - The private IP address to assign to an instance within a @abstr_hyperlink   * elastic_ip - Can be set to 'true', or to an existing Elastic IP address. If true, allocate a new Elastic IP address to the instance. If set to an existing Elastic IP address, assign the address to the instance.   * region - The region to start the instance in, such as ""us-east- @abstr_number ""   * secret_access_key - The secret access key for accessing AWS   * security_groups - An array of security groups for the instance. If this instance will be launched in VPC, this must be a list of security group Name. For a nondefault VPC, you must use security group IDs instead (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec @abstr_number /run-instances.html).   * iam_instance_profile_arn - The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the IAM Instance Profile to associate with the instance   * iam_instance_profile_name - The name of the IAM Instance Profile to associate with the instance   * subnet_id - The subnet to boot the instance into, for VPC.   * associate_public_ip - If true, will associate a public IP address to an instance in a VPC.   * ssh_host_attribute - If :public_ip_address, :dns_name, or :private_ip_address, will use the public IP address, DNS name, or private IP address, respectively, to SSH to the instance. By default Vagrant uses the first of these (in this order) that is known. However, this can lead to connection issues if, e.g., you are assigning a public IP address but your security groups prevent public SSH access and require you to SSH in via the private IP address; specify :private_ip_address in this case.   * tenancy - When running in a VPC configure the tenancy of the instance. Supports 'default' and 'dedicated'.   * tags - A hash of tags to set on the machine.   * package_tags - A hash of tags to set on the ami generated during the package operation.   * use_iam_profile - If true, will use @abstr_hyperlink for credentials.   * block_device_mapping - Amazon EC @abstr_number Block Device Mapping Property   * elb - The ELB name to attach to the instance.   * unregister_elb_from_az - Removes the ELB from the AZ on removal of the last instance if true (default). In non default VPC this has to be false.   * terminate_on_shutdown - Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance.    These can be set like typical provider-specific configuration:  @abstr_code_section  In addition to the above top-level configs, you can use the region_config method to specify region-specific overrides within your Vagrantfile. Note that the top-level region config must always be specified to choose which region you want to actually use, however. This looks like this:  @abstr_code_section  The region-specific configurations will override the top-level configurations when that region is used. They otherwise inherit the top-level configurations, as you would probably expect.  "
200,2245,"Networking features in the form of config.vm.network are not supported with vagrant-aws, currently. If any of these are specified, Vagrant will emit a warning, but will otherwise boot the AWS machine.  "
200,2246,"There is minimal support for synced folders. Upon vagrant up, vagrant reload, and vagrant provision, the AWS provider will use rsync (if available) to uni-directionally sync the folder to the remote machine over SSH.  See @abstr_hyperlink  "
200,2247, 
200,2248,"To use tags, simply define a hash of key/value for the tags you want to associate to your instance, like:  @abstr_code_section  "
200,2249,You can specify user data for the instance being booted.  @abstr_code_section  
200,2250,Need more space on your instance disk? Increase the disk size.  @abstr_code_section

201,2254,"YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for @abstr_hyperlink . It has several completion engines:    * an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based engine that provides native semantic code completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as ""the C-family languages""),   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for Python @abstr_number and @abstr_number (using the @abstr_hyperlink wrapper),   * an @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for C#,   * a combination of @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink semantic engines for Go,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for TypeScript,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for JavaScript,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for Rust,   * and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).    @abstr_image  Here's an explanation of what happens in the short GIF demo above.  First, realize that no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed to get the list of completion candidates at any point in the demo. The user just types and the suggestions pop up by themselves. If the user doesn't find the completion suggestions relevant and/or just wants to type, they can do so; the completion engine will not interfere.  When the user sees a useful completion string being offered, they press the TAB key to accept it. This inserts the completion string. Repeated presses of the TAB key cycle through the offered completions.  If the offered completions are not relevant enough, the user can continue typing to further filter out unwanted completions.  A critical thing to notice is that the completion filtering is NOT based on the input being a string prefix of the completion (but that works too). The input needs to be a _ @abstr_hyperlink match_ of a completion. This is a fancy way of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in the order in which they appear in the input. So abc is a subsequence of xaybgc, but not of xbyxaxxc. After the filter, a complicated sorting system ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of the menu (so you usually need to press TAB just once).  All of the above works with any programming language because of the identifier-based completion engine. It collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  The demo also shows the semantic engine in use. When the user presses ., -> or :: while typing in insert mode (for C++; different triggers are used for other languages), the semantic engine is triggered (it can also be triggered with a keyboard shortcut; see the rest of the docs).  The last thing that you can see in the demo is YCM's diagnostic display features (the little red X that shows up in the left gutter; inspired by @abstr_hyperlink ) if you are editing a C-family file. As Clang compiles your file and detects warnings or errors, they will be presented in various ways. You don't need to save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this, it ""just happens"" in the background.  In essence, YCM obsoletes the following Vim plugins because it has all of their features plus extra:    * clang_complete   * AutoComplPop   * Supertab   * neocomplcache    And that's not all...  YCM also provides semantic IDE-like features in a number of languages, including:    * finding declarations, definitions, usages, etc. of identifiers,   * displaying type information for classes, variables, functions etc.,   * displaying documentation for methods, members, etc. in the preview window,   * fixing common coding errors, like missing semi-colons, typos, etc.,   * semantic renaming of variables across files (JavaScript only).    Features vary by file type, so make sure to check out the file type feature summary and the full list of completer subcommands to find out what's available for your favourite languages.  You'll also find that YCM has filepath completers (try typing ./ in a file) and a completer that integrates with @abstr_hyperlink .  "

If your version is      @abstr_number . @abstr_number  then look below that where it says, Included patches:  @abstr_number -Z, where Z     will be some number. That number needs to be  @abstr_number  or higher.      If your version of Vim is not recent enough, you may need to [compile Vim     from source][vim-build] (don't worry, it's easy).      After you have made sure that you have Vim  @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number +, type the following in     Vim: :echo has('python') || has('python @abstr_number '). The output should be  @abstr_number . If     it's  @abstr_number , then get a version of Vim with Python support.      On Windows, check also if your Vim architecture is  @abstr_number  or  @abstr_number -bit. This is     critical because it must match the Python and the YCM libraries     architectures. We recommend using a  @abstr_number -bit Vim.   @abstr_number . Install YCM with @abstr_hyperlink (or @abstr_hyperlink , but Vundle is a better idea). With Vundle, this would mean adding a Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe' line to your @abstr_hyperlink .       If you don't install YCM with Vundle, make sure you have run     git submodule update --init --recursive after checking out the YCM     repository (Vundle will do this for you) to fetch YCM's dependencies.   @abstr_number . [Complete this step ONLY if you care about semantic completion support for C-family languages. Otherwise it's not necessary.]       Download the latest version of libclang. Clang is an open-source     compiler that can compile C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++. The libclang     library it provides is used to power the YCM semantic completion engine for     those languages. YCM is designed to work with libclang version  @abstr_number . @abstr_number  or     higher, but can in theory work with any  @abstr_number . @abstr_number + version as well.      You can use the system libclang _only if you are sure it is version  @abstr_number . @abstr_number  or     higher_, otherwise don't. Even if it is, we recommend using the [official     binaries from llvm.org][clang-download] if at all possible. Make sure you     download the correct archive file for your OS.      We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system libclang instead of     the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself the     hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.   @abstr_number . Compile theycm_core library that YCM needs. This library is the C++ engine that YCM uses to get fast completions.       You will need to have cmake installed in order to generate the required     makefiles. Linux users can install cmake with their package manager (sudo     apt-get install cmake for Ubuntu) whereas other users can [download and     install][cmake-download] cmake from its project site. Mac users can also get     it through [Homebrew][brew] with brew install cmake.      On a Unix OS, you need to make sure you have Python headers installed. On a     Debian-like Linux distro, this would be sudo apt-get install python-dev     python @abstr_number -dev. On Mac they should already be present.      On Windows, you need to download and install [Python  @abstr_number  or     Python  @abstr_number ][python-win-download]. Pick the version corresponding to your Vim     architecture. You will also need Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) to build YCM.     You can obtain it by installing [Visual Studio][visual-studio-download].     MSVC  @abstr_number  (Visual Studio  @abstr_number ),  @abstr_number  ( @abstr_number ), and  @abstr_number  ( @abstr_number ) are officially     supported.      Here we'll assume you installed YCM with Vundle. That means that the     top-level YCM directory is in ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe.      We'll create a new folder where build files will be placed. Run the     following:          cd ~         mkdir ycm_build         cd ycm_build      Now we need to generate the makefiles. If you DON'T care about semantic     support for C-family languages, run the following command in the ycm_build     directory:          cmake -G """" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where <generator> is Unix Makefiles on Unix systems and one of the     following Visual Studio generators on Windows:      - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number     - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number     - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number      Remove the Win @abstr_number part in these generators if your Vim architecture is      @abstr_number -bit.      For those who want to use the system version of boost, you would pass     -DUSE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON to cmake. This may be necessary on some systems     where the bundled version of boost doesn't compile out of the box.      NOTE: We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system boost instead     of the bundled version of boost. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the bundled version of boost.      If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, then your     cmake call will be a bit more complicated.  We'll assume you downloaded a     binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from llvm.org in step  @abstr_number  and that you     extracted the archive file to folder ~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir (with bin,     lib, include etc. folders right inside that folder). On Windows, you can     extract the files from the LLVM+Clang installer using [ @abstr_number -zip][ @abstr_number z-download].      NOTE: This _only_ works with a _downloaded_ LLVM binary package, not a     custom-built LLVM! See docs below for EXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH when using a     custom LLVM build.      With that in mind, run the following command in the ycm_build directory:          cmake -G """" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where <generator> is replaced like above.      Now that configuration files have been generated, compile the libraries     using this command:          cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release      The --config Release part is specific to Windows and will be ignored on a     Unix OS.      For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass     -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON to cmake _instead of_ the     -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=... flag.      NOTE: We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system libclang instead     of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.      You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with     -DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so flag (the library would end     with .dylib on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used _instead of_ the     other flags. If you compiled LLVM from source, this is the flag you should     be using.      Running the cmake command will also place the libclang.[so|dylib|dll] in     the YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd folder for you if you compiled with     clang support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).   @abstr_number . Set up support for additional languages, as desired:    * C# support: Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer and run msbuild (Windows) or xbuild (other platforms, using mono) depending on your platform. If mono is not installed, install it. When on Windows, be sure that @abstr_hyperlink .    * Go support: If go is not installed on your system, install it and add it to your path. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/gocode and run go build.    * TypeScript support: As with the quick installation, simply npm install -g typescript after successfully installing @abstr_hyperlink .    * JavaScript support: Install @abstr_hyperlink . Then navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime and run npm install --production    * Rust support: Install @abstr_hyperlink . Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/racerd and run cargo build --release.     That's it. You're done. Refer to the _User Guide_ section on how to use YCM. Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work, you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all in the User Guide.  YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a look at what's available for configuration. There are a few interesting options that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on.  "

201,2272," If the offered completions are too broad, keep typing characters; YCM will continue refining the offered completions based on your input.   * Filtering is ""smart-case"" sensitive; if you are typing only lowercase letters, then it's case-insensitive. If your input contains uppercase letters, then the uppercase letters in your query must match uppercase letters in the completion strings (the lowercase letters still match both). So, ""foo"" matches ""Foo"" and ""foo"", ""Foo"" matches ""Foo"" and ""FOO"" but not ""foo"".   * Use the TAB key to accept a completion and continue pressing TAB to cycle through the completions. Use Shift-TAB to cycle backwards. Note that if you're using console Vim (that is, not Gvim or MacVim) then it's likely that the Shift-TAB binding will not work because the console will not pass it to Vim. You can remap the keys; see the _ @abstr_hyperlink _ section below.    Knowing a little bit about how YCM works internally will prevent confusion. YCM has several completion engines: an identifier-based completer that collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  There are also several semantic engines in YCM. There's a libclang-based completer that provides semantic completion for C-family languages. There's a Jedi-based completer for semantic completion for Python. There's also an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language in YCM.  There are also other completion engines, like the UltiSnips completer and the filepath completer.  YCM automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any situation. On occasion, it queries several of them at once, merges the outputs and presents the results to you.   "
201,2273,YCM has a client-server architecture; the Vim part of YCM is only a thin client that talks to the @abstr_hyperlink that has the vast majority of YCM logic and functionality. The server is started and stopped automatically as you start and stop Vim.  
201,2274,"The subsequence filter removes any completions that do not match the input, but then the sorting system kicks in. It's actually very complicated and uses lots of factors, but suffice it to say that ""word boundary"" (WB) subsequence character matches are ""worth"" more than non-WB matches. In effect, this means given an input of ""gua"", the completion ""getUserAccount"" would be ranked higher in the list than the ""Fooguxa"" completion (both of which are subsequence matches). A word-boundary character are all capital characters, characters preceded by an underscore and the first letter character in the completion string.  "
201,2275," You can use Ctrl+Space to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere, even without a string prefix. This is useful to see which top-level functions are available for use.     "
201,2276,"YCM looks for a .ycm_extra_conf.py file in the directory of the opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when the file is found, it is loaded (only once!) as a Python module. YCM calls a FlagsForFile method in that module which should provide it with the information necessary to compile the current file. You can also provide a path to a global .ycm_extra_conf.py file, which will be used as a fallback. To prevent the execution of malicious code from a file you didn't write YCM will ask you once per .ycm_extra_conf.py if it is safe to load. This can be disabled and you can white-/blacklist files. See the _Options_ section for more details.  This system was designed this way so that the user can perform any arbitrary sequence of operations to produce a list of compilation flags YCM should hand to Clang.  @abstr_hyperlink for details on how this works. You should be able to use it _as a starting point_. Don't just copy/paste that file somewhere and expect things to magically work; your project needs different flags. Hint: just replace the strings in the flags variable with compilation flags necessary for your project. That should be enough for @abstr_number % of projects.  Yes, @abstr_hyperlink is also supported. Again, see the above linked example file. You can get CMake to generate this file for you by adding set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS @abstr_number ) to your project's CMakeLists.txt file (if using CMake). If you're not using CMake, you could use something like @abstr_hyperlink to generate the compile_commands.json file.  Consider using @abstr_hyperlink to generate the ycm_extra_conf.py file.  If Clang encounters errors when compiling the header files that your file includes, then it's probably going to take a long time to get completions. When the completion menu finally appears, it's going to have a large number of unrelated completion strings (type/function names that are not actually members). This is because Clang fails to build a precompiled preamble for your file if there are any errors in the included headers and that preamble is key to getting fast completions.  Call the :YcmDiags command to see if any errors or warnings were detected in your file.  "
201,2277, 
201,2278,"@abstr_number . Ensure that you have enabled the Tern completer. See the installation guide for details.  @abstr_number . Create a .tern-project file in the root directory of your JavaScript project, by following the @abstr_hyperlink in the @abstr_hyperlink documentation.  @abstr_number . Make sure that Vim's working directory is a descendent of that directory (or that directory itself) when working with JavaScript files.  "
201,2279,"JavaScript completion is based on @abstr_hyperlink . This completion engine requires a file named @abstr_hyperlink to exist in the current working directory or a directory which is an ancestor of the current working directory when the tern server is started. YCM starts the Tern server the first time a JavaScript file is edited, so Vim's working directory at that time needs to be a descendent of the directory containing the .tern-project file (or that directory itself).  Alternatively, as described in the @abstr_hyperlink , a global .tern-config file may be used.  Multiple Tern servers, are not supported. To switch to a different JavaScript project, you can do one of the following:    * start a new instance of Vim from the new project's directory   * change Vim's working directory (:cd /path/to/new/project) and restart the @abstr_hyperlink (:YcmRestartServer)   * change Vim's working directory (:cd /path/to/new/project), open a JavaScript file (or set filetype to JavaScript) and restart the Tern server using YCM completer subcommands :YcmCompleter StopServer and :YcmCompleter StartServer.    "
201,2280,"This section contains some advice for configuring .tern-project and working with JavaScript files. The canonical reference for correctly configuring Tern is the @abstr_hyperlink . Any issues, improvements, advice, etc. should be sought from the @abstr_hyperlink project. For example, see the @abstr_hyperlink for the list of plugins which can be enabled in the plugins section of the .tern-project file.  "
201,2281,The following simple example .tern-project file enables nodejs support:  @abstr_code_section  
201,2282,"The Tern requirejs plugin requires that all included ""libraries"" are rooted under the same base directory.

Then set up the .tern-project something like this:  @abstr_code_section  Then, given the following structure:  @abstr_code_section  Can be used as follows:  @abstr_code_section  "
201,2283,"Completions and GoTo commands within the current crate and its dependencies should work out of the box with no additional configuration (provided that you built YCM with the --racer-completer flag; see the Installation section for details).

You also need to set the following option so YouCompleteMe can locate it.  @abstr_code_section  "
201,2284,"Completion and GoTo commands work out of the box with no additional configuration. Those features are provided by the @abstr_hyperlink library which supports a variety of Python versions ( @abstr_number . @abstr_number , @abstr_number . @abstr_number , @abstr_number . @abstr_number +) as long as it runs in the corresponding Python interpreter. By default YCM runs @abstr_hyperlink with the same Python interpreter used by the @abstr_hyperlink , so if you would like to use a different interpreter, use the following option specifying the Python binary to use. For example, to provide Python @abstr_number completion in your project, set:  @abstr_code_section  "
201,2285,"Python, C#, Go, Rust, and TypeScript are supported natively by YouCompleteMe using the @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , and @abstr_hyperlink engines, respectively. Check the installation section for instructions to enable these features if desired.  YCM will use your omnifunc (see :h omnifunc in Vim) as a source for semantic completions if it does not have a native semantic completion engine for your file's filetype. Vim comes with okayish omnifuncs for various languages like Ruby, PHP etc. It depends on the language.  You can get stellar omnifuncs for Java and Ruby with @abstr_hyperlink . Just make sure you have the _latest_ Eclim installed and configured (this means Eclim >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number .* and Eclipse >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number .*).  After installing Eclim remember to create a new Eclipse project within your application by typing :ProjectCreate <path-to-your-project> -n ruby (or -n java) inside vim and don't forget to have let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc' in your vimrc. This will make YCM and Eclim play nice; YCM will use Eclim's omnifuncs as the data source for semantic completions and provide the auto-triggering and subsequence-based matching (and other YCM features) on top of it.  "
201,2286,"You have two options here: writing an omnifunc for Vim's omnicomplete system that YCM will then use through its omni-completer, or a custom completer for YCM using the @abstr_hyperlink .  Here are the differences between the two approaches:    * You have to use VimScript to write the omnifunc, but get to use Python to write for the Completer API; this by itself should make you want to use the API.   * The Completer API is a _much_ more powerful way to integrate with YCM and it provides a wider set of features. For instance, you can make your Completer query your semantic back-end in an asynchronous fashion, thus not blocking Vim's GUI thread while your completion system is processing stuff. This is impossible with VimScript. All of YCM's completers use the Completer API.   * Performance with the Completer API is better since Python executes faster than VimScript.    If you want to use the omnifunc system, see the relevant Vim docs with :h complete-functions. For the Completer API, see @abstr_hyperlink .  If you want to upstream your completer into YCM's source, you should use the Completer API.  "
201,2287,"YCM will display diagnostic notifications for C-family and C# languages if you compiled YCM with Clang and Omnisharp support, respectively. Since YCM continuously recompiles your file as you type, you'll get notified of errors and warnings in your file as fast as possible.  Here are the various pieces of the diagnostic UI:    * Icons show up in the Vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic.   * Regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted (by default, a red wavy underline in gvim and a red background in vim).   * Moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text.   * Vim's location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data (off by default, see options).    The new diagnostics (if any) will be displayed the next time you press any key on the keyboard. So if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to come in, that _will not work_. You need to press some key for the GUI to update.  Having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate, but cannot be changed due to the way Vim internals operate; there is no way that a background task can update Vim's GUI after it has finished running. You _have to_ press a key. This will make YCM check for any pending diagnostics updates.  You _can_ force a full, blocking compilation cycle with the :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics command (you may want to map that command to a key; try putting nnoremap <F @abstr_number > :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics<CR> in your vimrc). Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI _will_ be blocked.  YCM will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the line with the error. You can get a detailed diagnostic message with the <leader>d key mapping (can be changed in the options) YCM provides when your cursor is on the line with the diagnostic.  You can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the current file in Vim's locationlist, which can be opened with the :lopen and :lclose commands (make sure you have set let g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = @abstr_number in your vimrc). A good way to toggle the display of the locationlist with a single key mapping is provided by another (very small) Vim plugin called @abstr_hyperlink (which also makes it possible to change the height of the locationlist window), also written by yours truly.  "
201,2288,"You can change the styling for the highlighting groups YCM uses. For the signs in the Vim gutter, the relevant groups are:    * YcmErrorSign, which falls back to group SyntasticErrorSign and then error if they exist   * YcmWarningSign, which falls back to group SyntasticWarningSign and then todo if they exist    You can also style the line that has the warning/error with these groups:    * YcmErrorLine, which falls back to group SyntasticErrorLine if it exists   * YcmWarningLine, which falls back to group SyntasticWarningLine if it exists    Note that the line highlighting groups only work when gutter signs are turned on.

If a given error or warning can be fixed by a call to :YcmCompleter FixIt, then (FixIt available) is appended to the error or warning text. See the FixIt completer subcommand for more information.  NOTE: The absense of (FixIt available) does not strictly imply a fix-it is not available as not all completers are able to provide this indication. For example, the c-sharp completer provides many fix-its but does not add this additional indication.  The g:ycm_open_loclist_on_ycm_diags option can be used to prevent the location list from opening, but still have it filled with new diagnostic data. See the _Options_ section for details.  "

201,2296,"This command gives access to a number of additional IDE-like features in YCM, for things like semantic GoTo, type information, FixIt and refactoring.  Technically the command invokes completer-specific commands. If the first argument is of the form ft=... the completer for that file type will be used (for example ft=cpp), else the native completer of the current buffer will be used. Call YcmCompleter without further arguments for a list of the commands you can call for the current completer.  See the file type feature summary for an overview of the features available for each file type. See the _YcmCompleter subcommands_ section for more information on the available subcommands and their usage.  "
201,2297,"NOTE: See the docs for the YcmCompleter command before tackling this section.  The invoked subcommand is automatically routed to the currently active semantic completer, so :YcmCompleter GoToDefinition will invoke the GoToDefinition subcommand on the Python semantic completer if the currently active file is a Python one and on the Clang completer if the currently active file is a C/C++/Objective-C one.  You may also want to map the subcommands to something less verbose; for instance, nnoremap <leader>jd :YcmCompleter GoTo<CR> maps the <leader>jd sequence to the longer subcommand invocation.  "
201,2298,"These commands are useful for jumping around and exploring code. When moving the cursor, the subcommands add entries to Vim's jumplist so you can use CTRL-O to jump back to where you where before invoking the command (and CTRL-I to jump forward; see :h jumplist for details).  "

Currently, this means that it tries to look up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its definition if possible; if the definition is not accessible from the current translation unit, jumps to the symbol's declaration.

203,2468,"The Network Engine provides to unmodified SDN applications (called Modules in the Figure below) the runtime they expect. Additionally it implements a composition mechanism to create new applications from previously implemented modules and to make them cooperating with modules running on top of the operator’s controller (represented by the Server Controller in the Figure), effectively building a single Network Application.  The Network Engine follows the layered SDN controller approach proposed by the Open Networking Foundation. It comprises a client controller layer that executes the modules network applications are composed of and a server SDN controller layer that drives the underlying infrastructure.  The challenge is to integrate client and server controllers. To maximize reuse, we use separate adaptors for the Southbound Interface (SBI), called Backend, and for the Northbound Interface (NBI), called Shim. This separation imposes a protocol between them, the NetIDE Intermediate Protocol (see the full protocol specification in libraries/netip/docs). In our first implementations [ @abstr_number ] we have proved that the Shim/Backend structure connected by an intermediate protocol is feasible and sensible. However, they still left the fundamental component in these modules: the composition logic. This implied that it needed to be reimplemented for each controller framework we wanted to support. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an intermediate layer, the Core: it hosts all logic and data structures that are independent of the particular controller frameworks and communicates with both Shim and Backend using the same NetIDE Intermediate Protocol. The Core makes both Shim and Backend light-weight and easier to implement for new controllers.  This repository contains source code and documentation of the Core, Shim (implemented for OpenDaylight, ONOS and Ryu) and Backend (implemented for Ryu and Floodlight), plus some utilities for testing the Network Engine.

211,2522,"Before we dive into this lab, we need to tell you something: remember how easy it was to iterate over an array with a for or a while loop? Well, it's nearly as easy to iterate over an object in the same way. (Remember, arrays are essentially fancy objects — it makes sense that iteration would be similar.)  But objects don't have sequential indexes like arrays do, so we need another way of getting the keys. Luckily, that's exactly what Object.keys() is for!  @abstr_code_section  But this is a little verbose and sort of hard to read: we have to get the name of the meal using mealNames[i] and then use that name as a key in the object meals to get the food for that meal (meals[mealNames[i]]). Gross.  There's a (slightly) better way! JavaScript has a special loop, called for...in, that makes iterating over objects a bit easier:  @abstr_code_section  Much better.  NOTE : You can use for...in loops with arrays, too, but the variable that you get will just be the index (in order), so this particular loop is _usually_ used with objects.  "

215,2536,"The eleVR Picture Player lets you watch @abstr_number flat and stereo equirectangular panoramas on your Oculus Rift, Android, or iPhone device with VR headset (Cardboard, Durovis Dive, etc.) from a web browser. It is written with js, html @abstr_number , and webGL. It depends on the open source libraries as noted in the @abstr_hyperlink section.  eleVR Picture Player works with the native browser support currently being implemented by @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .  The player is a fun fork of the @abstr_hyperlink with some changes to optimize the player for showing panoramic pictures.  Pictures shown in the player can be rotated using keyboard controls (a/d, w/s, and q/e), as well as by the Oculus Rift if you are running an experimental webVR browser. You may be able to decrease video judder by setting your Oculus Display refresh rate to @abstr_number Hz (the browser refreshes at @abstr_number Hz and the slower mismatch can cause judder).  "

215,2538,"Using keyboard rotation controls, the player works on standard Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It also runs on Safari (if webgl is enabled). I haven't tested it on other browsers.  Using Oculus headset controls, the player works on the experimental webVR builds of @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .  Using device orientation controls, it works on Safari on iPhone and Chrome on Android devices.  "
215,2539,"The easiest way to run your own picture is to click the folder icon and load your video from there. You may then need to choose the projection for your picture from the projection selector.  You can load your own picture from the javascript console, by typing loadVideo("" @abstr_number myVideo.mp @abstr_number ""). If your video is equirectangular @abstr_number D, preface your picture by @abstr_number . If it is stereo top/bottom, preface it by @abstr_number . These numbers correspond to the projections in the projectionEnum declaration in elevr-player.js.

224,2616,因为之前微软推出了typescript语言，结合tsd文件，用visual studio写typescript代码是相当爽的，智能提示的功能非常nb。  这个功能理所应当也被vsc继承了。  vsc的自动补全用的是tsd。  TSD is a package manager to search and install TypeScript definition files directly from the community driven DefinitelyTyped repository.  https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd  目前主流的前端类库/框架，包括node.js及其模块/框架都有相应的tsd文件，可以去 @abstr_hyperlink 上找一下。  那么就可以安装tsd之后，使用  @abstr_code_section  此时看一下当前目录，下面的express.d.ts文件即是具体提示用的。  @abstr_code_section  在代码编辑区里，输入CTRL+SPACE就可以有提示了。  @abstr_image  目前node.d.ts版本还是 @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number ，和node v @abstr_number 的api差不了多少  
224,2617, 
224,2618,@abstr_code_section  对应的快捷键是shift + command + p  敲完后，输入tri  @abstr_image  
224,2619,但是CTRL+SPACE在我的电脑里已经占用了，所以还是需要修改一下的，见下图  打开快捷键配置  @abstr_image  修改如下  @abstr_image  即把  @abstr_code_section  改成  @abstr_code_section  此时，就是输入SHIFT+SPACE就可以有提示了  
224,2620,原理说明：我们可以看到 @abstr_number 个配置文件，一个是不能修改的，另一个是空的，后面的会把前面的覆盖  这其实和 @abstr_hyperlink 原理是类似的  @abstr_code_section  把options里的覆盖$.fn.tab.defaults。

224,2624,举个简单例子，在index.html里  输入link，然后tab键，就会生成下面的代码  @abstr_code_section  连续输入类和id，比如p.bar#foo，会自动生成：  @abstr_code_section  输入h @abstr_number {foo}和a[href=#]，就可以自动生成如下代码：  @abstr_code_section  写html代码足够快了，享受吧，更多用法见    * http://www.iteye.com/news/ @abstr_number   * http://docs.emmet.io/    
224,2625,在写node.js代码的时候，有时会忘记某个模块中有哪些方法及其用法，经常要去官网翻一下api文档。  这里介绍下怎么使用vsc来搞定这一问题。  @abstr_number . 打开vsc控制台（Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console） @abstr_number . 在控制台写代码，查询模块方法。  过程如下图：  @abstr_image  vsc是用atom-shell(现在叫electron)写的，这玩意和node-webkit（现在叫nw.js）一样，都是把node.js和chrome结合起来的工具，所以可以这么使用。  不过vsc使用到的node.js模块并不多，比如引用util和vm等会报错，用node-webkit就不会这样。  
224,2626,按照一般app的设计，都是主应用，和用户目录下的缓存文件，把用户自定义的或使用生成的文件都放到缓存文件目录里。鉴于此，我们来找找code.app的缓存文件，或许能发现点有用的东西  
224,2627,目录是 /Users/sang/Library/Application Support/Code  @abstr_code_section  这些文件我们能看懂的就尽量看，看不懂的也无所谓，如果想深度了解里面的机制，还是有必要看看的。  
224,2628,storage.json是code.app的核心配置文件，就像npm里的package.json一样。  看一下具体内容  @abstr_code_section  说明    * updateChannel 应该检查版本更新的设置   * windowUIState 界面状态，还记得分割编辑窗口吧？   * openedPathsList 应该是File -> Open Recent里的内容   * theme 用户配色方案   * folderPickerWorkingDir 执行command + o 打开的目录   * lastActiveOpenedPath 最后打开的目录（这个目录是我执行vsc直接打开的）    为什么要了解它呢？  如果你理解了上面的配置起什么作用，那么你是不是可以干很多坏事儿呢？比如    * 备份   * 可视化   * 其他hack    剩下的自己发挥吧  
224,2629,上面的目录结构基本都可以看懂，对应当前用户来说  @abstr_code_section  
224,2630,比如快捷键  @abstr_code_section  是不是和我们之前配置的一样?  
224,2631,@abstr_code_section  和上面的是一样的，就不打印了。如果想每次都定义一下的话，可以自己修改，以后对当前用户就是全局的了  
224,2632,User/snippets是snippets存放位置，比如javascript的定义  见  @abstr_code_section  
224,2633,"@abstr_code_section  说明：    * ""Print to console"" 是智能提示显示的   * ""prefix"" 是用户输入的字母，比如本例中输入log自动提示   * 当用户触发此snippet的时候，会按照""body""里代码生成   * $ @abstr_number 代表光标位置    自己按照上面的方法定义自己的snippets，可以提高很多工作效率哦  下面看一下如何在代码中使用snippet，如图  @abstr_image  "
224,2634," electron 打包成可执行文件   * 使用了一些atom模块、第三方模块    app的安装目录是 /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app,右键show package content，然后一层一层的找里面的内容就可以了  @abstr_code_section  下面我们来看一下里面的内容  @abstr_code_section   "
224,2635,@abstr_code_section  
224,2636,@abstr_code_section  很多人抱怨，vsc没有提供插件机制，想想还是笑笑吧，机制已经很健全了，开放只是早晚的事儿。  
224,2637,out是一个比较有趣的目录，所有代码都是混淆过的，但可以从其文件名和目录名称看出一些东西  @abstr_code_section  bootstrap.js是启动的脚本  默认支持的语言    * annotatedLanguage   * csharp   * css   * handlebars   * html   * javascript   * json   * less   * markdown   * php   * plaintext   * razor   * sass   * typescript   * vsxml    vs/base/browser/ui/是界面里用的svg图，如果想自定义界面可以自行修改  vs/base/node/terminateProcess.sh写的不错  @abstr_code_section  /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/editor/css是编辑器vs-theme.css样式  /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/workbench/browser/css是workbench的vs-theme.css样式  
224,2638, 
224,2639,看看它依赖的第三方开源模块  @abstr_code_section  注意一下里面atom相关的模块  
224,2640,@abstr_code_section  
224,2641, 
224,2642,vsc其实不管你的git初始化的，只要你当前是git管理的，它的git部分才有用。  也就是说git需要自己处理。  比如  @abstr_code_section  如果要切换分支，可以用checkout命令  @abstr_code_section  如果是已有分支就  @abstr_code_section  
224,2643,要支持es @abstr_number 的话，需要在项目下建一个jsconfig.json，内容为  @abstr_code_section  嫌麻烦的话可以安装下@hellopao 写的模块 @abstr_hyperlink ，通过命令行来生成该文件  @abstr_code_section  
224,2644,目前还没有，需要等  
224,2645,"vsc和其他编辑器（sublime text,atom,webstorm等）相比，某些方面还存在很多问题。对于一个前端工程师来说，它已经足够好了。  推荐使用~  "

227,2663,"A BOSH release of a MySQL database-as-a-service for Cloud Foundry using @abstr_hyperlink and a @abstr_hyperlink .  Component| Description ---|--- @abstr_hyperlink  | Advertises the MySQL service and plans.

Currently using MariaDB @abstr_number (versions vary by release). Proxy |  @abstr_hyperlink ; proxies to MySQL, severing connections on MySQL node failure.  "
227,2664,"Traffic to the MySQL cluster is routed through one or more proxy nodes. The current proxy implementation is @abstr_hyperlink . This proxy acts as an intermediary between the client and the MySQL server, providing failover between MySQL nodes. The number of nodes is configured by the proxy job instance count in the deployment manifest.  NOTE: If the number of proxy nodes is set to zero, apps will be bound to the IP address of the first MySQL node in the cluster. If that IP address should change for any reason (e.g. loss of a VM) or a proxy was subsequently added, one would need to re-bind all apps to the IP address of the new node.  For more details see the proxy documentation.  "
227,2665,A user-facing service dashboard is provided by the service broker that displays storage utilization information for each service instance. The dashboard is accessible by users via Single Sign-On (SSO) once authenticated with Cloud Foundry. The dashboard URL can be found by running cf service MY_SERVICE_INSTANCE.  Service authors interested in implementing a service dashboard accessible via SSO can follow documentation for @abstr_hyperlink .  
227,2666,"@abstr_number . SSO is initiated when a user navigates to the URL found in the dashboard_url field. This value is returned to cloud controller by the broker in response to a provision request, and is exposed in the cloud controller API for the service instance. A users client must expose this field as a link, or it can be obtained via curl (cf curl /v @abstr_number /service_instances/:guid) and copied into a browser.  @abstr_number . SSO requires the following OAuth client to be configured in cf-release. This client is responsible for creating the OAuth client for the MySQL dashboard. Without this client configured in cf-release, the MySQL dashboard will not be accessible but the service will be otherwise functional. Registering the broker will display a warning to this effect.        @abstr_code_section   @abstr_number . SSO was implemented in v @abstr_number of cf-release; if you are on an older version of cf-release you'll encounter an error when you register the service broker. If upgrading cf-release is not an option, try removing the following lines from the cf-mysql-release manifest and redeploy.        @abstr_code_section   "
227,2667,"The following links show how this release implements @abstr_hyperlink integration.  @abstr_number . Update the broker catalog with the dashboard client @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number .

227,2669,"The dashboard URL defaults to using the https scheme. This means any requests using http will automatically be redirected to https instead. To override this, you can change jobs.cf-mysql-broker.ssl_enabled to false.  Keep in mind that changing the ssl_enabled setting for an existing broker will not update previously advertised dashboard URLs. Visiting the old URL may fail if you are using the @abstr_hyperlink , because the OAuth @abstr_number client registered with UAA will expect users to both come from and return to a URI using the scheme implied by the ssl_enabled setting.  Note: If using https, the broker must be reached through an SSL termination proxy. Connecting to the broker directly on https will result in a port @abstr_number : Connection refused error.  "
227,2670,"By default, the broker will not trust a self-signed SSL certificate when communicating with cf-release. To trust self-signed SSL certificates, you can change jobs.cf-mysql-broker.skip_ssl_validation to true.  "

The one hard requirement is that you do not rely on an external API framework. Choices like class-based or function-based views are up to you. In fact for clarity you may find function based views more of an optimal choice for this assignment.

Therefore, these X clients need to be already installed on your system: xeyes, xclock, xterm. In order to run the window manager as a client in your current window manager, you'll need xephyr and scons.  There are two options for using this X window manager. Option @abstr_number is to compile the program by installing scons and running the ./build_and_run.sh file without xephyr by setting it as your native window manager (you can use the provided xinitrc file to replace ~/.xinitrc). Option @abstr_number is to install scons, and use xephyr to run the window manager from within your current X session. It is assumed that the program will be tested before use, so this is the default setting for the build_and_run.sh script.  Execution: Execute the build_and_run.sh file to Make and connect the window manager to the X server as an X client.  ./build_and_run.sh  Once scons compiles our program, xephyr launches a few programs inside of the new window manager.  Congratulations on making it this far! If you had problems installing LightWM see the toubleshooting section at the end of this readme.  Commands:  Close (kill) a window: ALT + Q  Move a window: Hold ALT and select a window with the mouse. Drag to reposition. Release mouse to stop.  Launch a new xterm window as a child process: ALT + Enter  Cycle top window focus: ALT + Tab  And of course, feel free to launch any program via xterm.  Troubleshooting: Make sure to install xorg-xeyes, xorg-xclock, xterm, xephyr (unless using lightWM as primary window manager), and scons with your operating system's package manager. LightWM does not support multiple monitor X configurations, and may be unable to load xorg.conf configuration files with multiple screens. "

247,2790,"IntentKit is an easier way to handle third-party URL schemes in iOS apps.  @abstr_image  Linking to third-party apps is essentially broken on iOS. Let's say that, as a developer, you want to allow users to open map links in Google Maps instead of the built-in Maps.app. You now need to write a whole bunch of custom code that determines whether Google Maps is installed, ask the user which they would prefer, and ideally remember that preference.  If we take a more complex example, like Twitter clients, you're now potentially managing a dozen different third-party URL schemes that are all drastically different and quite possibly poorly-documented.  As a result, very few apps link to external third-party apps for tasks handled by Apple's easier-to-link-to apps, even when users prefer third-party apps.  IntentKit attempts to solve this problem.  For users , it provides a beautiful selection interface to choose which third-party app to perform an action in.  For developers , it provides:    * An elegant, cohesive API based on semantic actions. Instead of manually constructing URLs or creating modal view controllers to display, just tell it what you're trying to do. Instead of manually checking which applications a user has installed, let IntentKit automatically query the device for you to figure out what applications are available to perform a given action.    * A unified, human-readable repository of third-party URL schemes. Every application's URL scheme is just a plaintext plist. You can add support for your application to IntentKit without writing a single line of code.     "
247,2791,"IntentKit is easiest to install using @abstr_hyperlink . Just add the following to your Podfile.       pod ""IntentKit""   After running pod install, you should be able to #import any INKHandler header file (e.g. #import <INKMailHandler.h>) and go to town.  If you're concerned about the increase in your app bundle's size, you can choose to only include a subset of IntentKit's supported applications. Subspecs exist for each handler class.       # Only includes web browsers     pod ""IntentKit/Browsers""   For more information on what subspecs are available, refer to the project's @abstr_hyperlink .  "
247,2792,"To use IntentKit, you start by instantiating a handler object. There are a handful of handler objects that come with IntentKit, each with domain knowledge of a specific type of application. For example, INKBrowserHandler, INKMapsHandler, and INKTwitterHandler handle opening links in web browsers, mapping applications, and Twitter clients, respectively.  After creating a new handler object, you just tell it what action you want to perform. It will return you a special object called a presenter, which can be used to actually perform the action. Here's how you'd open an email compose screen on an iPhone:  @abstr_code_section  If the user doesn't have any third-party mail apps installed (such as Mailbox or Google's native Gmail app), this will display an in-line MFMailComposeViewController, just as if you had created and presented one yourself. If the user does have other mail apps installed, this will display a modal sheet that looks like a UIActivityViewController listing each available application. It will also give them a switch they can tap to remember their choice for all future links of that type.  "

248,2814,"The WebApi module supports two routing strategies: Wildcard and Regex. By default, and in order to maintain backwards compatibility, the WebApi module will use the Wildcard Routing Strategy and match routes using the asterisk * character in the route. For example: - The route /api/people/* will match any request with a URL starting with the two first URL segments api and people and ending with anything. The route /api/people/hello will be matched. - You can also use wildcards in the middle of the route. The route /api/people/*/details will match requests starting with the two first URL segments api and people, and ending with a details segment. The route /api/people/hello/details will be matched.  _Note that most REST services can be designed with this simpler Wildcard routing startegy. However, the Regex matching strategy is the current recommended approach as we might be deprecating the Wildcard strategy altogether_  On the other hand, the Regex Routing Strategy will try to match and resolve the values from a route template, in a similar fashion to Microsoft's Web API @abstr_number . A method with the following route /api/people/{id} is going to match any request URL with three segments: the first two api and people and the last one is going to be parsed or converted to the type in the id argument of the handling method signature. Please read on if this was confusing as it is much simpler than it sounds. Additionally, you can put multiple values to match, for example /api/people/{mainSkill}/{age}, and receive the parsed values from the URL straight into the arguments of your handler method.  _During server setup:_  @abstr_code_section  _And our controller class (using Regex Strategy) looks like:_  @abstr_code_section  _Or if you want to use the Wildcard strategy (which is the default):_  @abstr_code_section  "

The smaller the board is, the fewer cells you have, and the harder the game is.*   * Three game modes : The original Power of @abstr_number , i.e. combining two tiles of the same value to produce their sum. The Power of @abstr_number , i.e. combining _three_ consecutive tiles of the same value to produce their sum. Not surprisingly, this is pretty hard with the @abstr_number x @abstr_number board, although I found it pretty easy to get @abstr_number . @abstr_number is a different story...

(I omitted the two @abstr_number 's in the beginning) to produce the one next to the larger value. This is pretty tricky. Try it out and you will know what I mean.   * Three themes : I made a bright theme and a 'joyful' theme in addition to the original one. In case you wonder how to do themes in iOS. (There may be a better way, but themes are verbose in nature, because you _have to_ specify all the colors, fonts, etc.)    "

Not that Cocos- @abstr_number D is not great, but the fact it's using SpriteKit means that it does not have any dependencies.   * It does not have any images. That's right.

258,2915,"First off, the best thing about the code is that it's pretty well documented. Most methods have the Apple-style documentation, which means that you can triple-click on the method name to get its documentation.  The code started to resemble the structure of the original @abstr_number . So for example, it has a game manager, a board class, a tile class, etc. I at least _tried_ to stick to MVC as much as possible. Here is a brief summary to get you started:    * The M @abstr_number GameManager class controls the game logic. There is only one action in the game: move. So the majority of that class is handling the move. The rest is checking whether you've won or died, etc.   * The M @abstr_number Grid class is the data structure for the board. The original @abstr_number used a @abstr_number -D array, but heck, @abstr_number -D array doesn't seem to be too bad here! ...except looping it is a bit ugly, so I made a forEach helper function.   * The M @abstr_number Cell class is the ""slot""s. They are not the tiles themselves. The benefit of having this class is that the cells never move, so they are good references and they don't mess stuff up.   * The M @abstr_number Tile class is the actual tile, and this is the actual SpriteKit class. If all you want is some sample code for SpriteKit, here it is. I believe my animations are smoother than the other @abstr_number on the App Store, and are closer to the original animation.   * The M @abstr_number GlobalState class is a global class accessible from anywhere in the universe. Well, global stuff is evil, right? At least so we are told. But, it is at least better to encapsulate the global stuff into one single object (namespace), and that's a singleton right there.   * The M @abstr_number Theme class and its subclasses control the theme.   * There are also some controller classes and view classes. It's probably a better idea to do the Game Over scene in SpriteKit, but I was lazy so I faked it using a view. The M @abstr_number GridView class is the one that draws the board, btw.    "
258,2916,"If you'd like to contribute, great! That's more than welcome. If you do make improvements to it, remember to put yourself in the ""About @abstr_number "" page to get yourself credit.

264,2966,This software is a ROS node that generates RAVEN motion commands for it to follow a predefined circle trajectory. The circle RADIUS and orbitting speed are tunable. There are @abstr_number ROS nodes in this folder: talkerAutoCircle and listenerAutoCircle.  
264,2967,The two ROS nodes talkerAutoCircle and listenerAutoCircle exchange information through ROS topics. Below are the two ROS topics that this software use in order to communicate with the main RAVEN software. This is the @abstr_hyperlink to the .msg files.  @abstr_number . raven_state.msg : This topic stores current RAVEN position and orientation values. @abstr_number . raven_automove.msg : This topic stores the motion command for RAVEN to move accordingly.  
264,2968,"@abstr_number . talkerAutoCircle : This ROS node is the command generator. It subscribes to raven_state.msg ROS topic to get current RAVEN status, then computes corresponding motion commands for the robot arm to follow circle trajectory. Finally, it publishes to raven_automove.msg ROS topic. @abstr_number . listenerAutoCircle : This ROS node is only for testing. It serves the same purpose as the main RAVEN software, and will be replaced during actual use. It communicates with the talkerAutoCircle by listening to the motion commands and sends out RAVEN position and orientation feedback after following the command. Thus, it subscribes to raven_automove.msg ROS topic, and updates RAVEN position and orientation accordingly, then publishes raven_state.msg ROS topic to show how the robot arm is currently posed.  "
264,2969,"This is the big picture of what files are in this AutoCircle_generater repository and what are each files are for. Note that only the ones specified as (original) are the original files created here, others are copied from the main RAVEN software and do NOT need to copy again to the main RAVEN software when combining.  /msg folder:  ---- raven_automove.msg  ---- raven_state.msg /src folder:  ---- /raven_ @abstr_number folder:  -------- raven_automove.h  -------- raven_state.h  ---- DS @abstr_number .h  ---- DS @abstr_number .h  ---- Raven_Controller.cpp --------------------- (original)  ---- Raven_Controller.h ----------------------- (original)This class controls the threads and workflow.  ---- Raven_PathPlanner.cpp -------------------- (original)  ---- Raven_PathPlanner.h ---------------------- (original)This class defines all the math and path planning.  ---- listener.cpp ----------------------------- (original)This will be replaced with main RAVEN software.  ---- talker.cpp ------------------------------- (original)This file is where main is.  ---- tools.h AutoCircle Generator flowchart.png ----------- (original)The ROS publish/subscribe flowchart for better understanding.  CMakeLists.txt ------------------------------- (original)Should merge with CMakeLists.txt in main RAVEN software.  README.md ------------------------------------ (original)This file!  package.xml ---------------------------------- (original)The ROS package.xml file.  The file talker.cpp is the heart of AutoCircle generater, it is where the main is. This file uses on methods defined in class Raven_Controller. Inside of class Raven_Contoller, there are two threads - ros_thread and console_thread, which takes charge of the ROS publishing/subscribing issues and user console inputs respectively. The class Raven_Contoller depends on class Raven_PathPlanner to compute and design circular trajectories. So, it is basically where all the math is! In the class Raven_Controller, there are two Raven_PathPlanner objects managing the motion of LEFT and RIGHT arm of RAVEN. (All these files belong to the talkerAutoCircle ROS node.) And since we are NOT actually connected to the main RAVEN software yet, we have listener.cpp as the simplified version to simulate the main RAVEN software just so talker.cpp has someone to interact with. Thus, listener.cpp will be completely replaced when we actually combine it with the RAVEN code. (This file belongs to the listenerAutoCircle ROS node.)  "
264,2970,"This software design allows RAVEN to be controlled and follow predefined circular trajectory from any remote computer, so below is the instruction for hardware setup and terminal commands for it to work. Computer A: The computer that downloads this AutoCircle_generater software and runsroscore from here. Computer B: This is the computer that RAVEN main software runs on. (This should be already setup and ready to go.)  @abstr_number . Find out hostname and IP : On both computer A and computer B, open up a terminal, type in ""hostname"" to find out the hostname of that computer and type in ""ifconfig"" to find out the IP address. Note that it will be better and more stable connection-wise if both computers are connected to wired internet. Because wireless connections does not have static IP, and can cause floating IP problem which may cause us to lose connection midway through your control. Up to this point, we should have: IP for computer A and B (denoted as IP_A and IP_B later on in the instruction),as well as the hostname for computer A and B (denoted as hostname_A and hostname_B later on in the instruction).  @abstr_number . Download AutoCircle_generater code : On computer A, type in ""git clone git://github.com/melodysu @abstr_number /AutoCircle_generater.git"" to download this repository to the directory you desire. It should create a AutoCircle_generater folder under that directory. Note that this should be a directory under the your ROS workspace. Then go back to your ROS workspace directory, type in ""catkin_make_isolated --pkg AutoCircle_generater"", and this should build the software. Now this part of the software is done.  @abstr_number . ssh : On computer A, open up another terminal and type in ""ssh -X hostname_A@IP_B"", it should allow you to control computer B from this terminal. Assume you already have RAVEN running on this computer, type in ""pwd"", and then ""roscd raven_ @abstr_number "". Note that this RAVEN code should be the RAVEN @abstr_number . @abstr_number release version in October @abstr_number , because there is a pedal down/pedal up switch where you can control by pressing 'd' and 'u' keys respectively. And this feature is required for the AutoCircle_generater to work. If you don't have the version yet, you can download it from @abstr_hyperlink , and use the indigo branch.  @abstr_number . Up and running : On computer A, open up another terminal and run ""roscore"". Use ths terminal is step @abstr_number , type in ""sudo roslaunch raven_ @abstr_number raven_ @abstr_number .launch"". Next, initialize RAVEN. After it is initialized, press 'd' and it holds the pedal down state for @abstr_number seconds. If no commend is sent within the time range, it will automatically switch back to pedal up state. If you are constantantly sending commends, then RAVEN will be in pedal down state all the time until you press 'u' manually. But you can always re-press 'd' again if you need to. Within the @abstr_number second, use the terminal in step @abstr_number , type in ""rosrun AutoCircle_genetater talkerAutoCircle"" under the main ROS workspace directory, and you sill need to press ""Enter"" to start. At this point, you should see RAVEN moving slowly in very small circles already if everything is good.  "
264,2971,"These are the problems that may occur to you. Basically if you are running AutoCircle_generater code, and still the pedal down state in RAVEN holds for @abstr_number seconds then jumps back to pedal up, that means there is something wrong with the connection. Try doing the following to identify the problem . If you cannot even run the RAVEN code from terminal in step @abstr_number , then it is not even sensing the ""roscore"" on computer A.  @abstr_number . Internet Connection Issue : (If you cannot run RAVEN code) On the terminal in step @abstr_number , where you ssh to computer B, type in ""ping hostname_A"", and make sure it works well. If not, try ""ping IP_A"". If hostname_A fails but IP_A works, that means computer B does not know the name of computer A. Do it by typing in ""gedit /etc/hosts"" and add in hostname_A IP_A to the list of hosts. If even ""ping IP_A"" does not work, then there is some internet issue, try checking your internet connection and double check the IP address. Do the same process for computer A on any other terminal, only to change by typing ""ping hostname_B"" and ""ping IP_B"". If both sides are working good,  @abstr_number . ROS_MASTER_URL : Make sure you set the ROS_MASTER_URL correctly. It should be the following: On regular terminal on computer A, type in ""gedit ~/.bashrc"", then set ROS_MASTER_URL = host_A (or IP_A), ROS_IP = host_A (or IP_A). On the terminal you ssh to computer B, type in ""gedit ~/.bashrc"", then set ROS_MASTER_URL = host_A (or IP_A), ROS_IP = host_B (or IP_B). This can be a tricky part, so be sure to set it correctly. This should ensure the ROS topic publishing and subscribing to be bidirectional.  @abstr_number . rostopic monitoring : You can type in ""rostoppic echo topicname -c"" this on each side to monitor the publishing and subscribing condition and check if it's the problem of receiving ravenstate or sending raven_automove.  "
264,2972,"User can choose the circle speed, radius, direction(clockwise or counter-clockwise), base plane(Y-Z plane, X-Z plane, X-Y plane), center of the circle, as well as whether or not to display motion status on console. Note that only the Y-Z base plane will generate horizontal circle motion, the other two are vertical. There are @abstr_number levels of speed and @abstr_number levels of radius. In horizontal circles (Y-Z base plane) under radius level @abstr_number and @abstr_number , we can only increase the speed up to level @abstr_number , while larger radius (level @abstr_number ~ @abstr_number ) allows max speed to be level @abstr_number . In vertical circles (Y-Z and X-Z base plane), it requires more torque so we set max speed to be level @abstr_number under all radius.  "
264,2973,"These are the constraints we set for our physical device - RAVEN surgical robot arm to function normally. These are mostly defined in @abstr_hyperlink file under /src folder. Be careful when tuning these values!  @abstr_number . publish rate : The raven_automove.msg is being sent at @abstr_number Hz.  @abstr_number . feedback rate : The raven_state.msg is being sent at @abstr_number Hz in listener.cpp. But in actual RAVEN software, raven_state.msg is updated at @abstr_number Hz.  @abstr_number . DEL_POS_THRESHOLD : This is the motion translation threshold for RAVEN to move. It is set as @abstr_number micro meter (= @abstr_number . @abstr_number mm = @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm). That being said, the maximum speed that RAVEN will be moving is @abstr_number Hz * @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm = @abstr_number (cm/sec).  @abstr_number . DEL_ROT_THRESHOLD : This is the motion rotation threshold for RAVEN to move. It is set to be @abstr_number . @abstr_number degrees. That being said, the maximum rotational speed for RAVEN will be is @abstr_number Hz * @abstr_number . @abstr_number degrees = @abstr_number (degrees/sec). This is currently unused because the circle trajectoy we have now does NOT include orientation motion.  @abstr_number . RADIUS levels : There are ten levels of RADIUS to choose from. Level @abstr_number ~ @abstr_number corresponds to @abstr_number micro meter (= @abstr_number mm = @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm) ~ @abstr_number micro meter (= @abstr_number mm = @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm). Yet that is the desired radius. From our experiments, the relation between desired radius and actual radius are listed as follows: actual radius = desired radius * @abstr_number / @abstr_number + @abstr_number . @abstr_number  @abstr_number . SPEED levels : There are sixty levels of SPEED to choose from, with each level increasing @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm/sec from the previous level. So level @abstr_number ~ @abstr_number corresponds to moving @abstr_number . @abstr_number cm/sec (= @abstr_number mm/sec = @abstr_number . @abstr_number mm per command) all the way up to @abstr_number cm/sec (= @abstr_number mm/sec = @abstr_number . @abstr_number mm per command, which is exactly DEL_POS_THRESHOLD).

"
265,2979,"If you are interested in Spring Boot, I have moved the boot branch into a new project @abstr_hyperlink . "
266,2980,"This project is an application skeleton for a typical @abstr_hyperlink web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.  The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.  The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.  "
266,2981,To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:  
266,2982,You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from @abstr_hyperlink .  We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from @abstr_hyperlink .  
266,2983,Clone the angular-seed repository using @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:  @abstr_code_section  The depth= @abstr_number tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.  
266,2984,"We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code. The tools help us manage and test the application.    * We get the tools we depend upon via npm, the @abstr_hyperlink .   * We get the angular code via bower, a @abstr_hyperlink .    We have preconfigured npm to automatically run bower so we can simply do:  @abstr_code_section  Behind the scenes this will also call bower install. You should find that you have two new folders in your project.    * node_modules - contains the npm packages for the tools we need   * app/bower_components - contains the angular framework files    _Note that thebower_components folder would normally be installed in the root folder but angular-seed changes this location through the .bowerrc file. Putting it in the app folder makes it easier to serve the files by a webserver._  "
266,2985,We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:  @abstr_code_section  Now browse to the app at http://localhost: @abstr_number /index.html.  
266,2986,@abstr_code_section  
266,2987,There are two kinds of tests in the angular-seed application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.  
266,2988,"The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in @abstr_hyperlink , which we run with the @abstr_hyperlink . We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.    * the configuration is found at karma.conf.js   * the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as ..._test.js.    The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:  @abstr_code_section  This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change. This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.  You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a predefined script to do this:  @abstr_code_section  "
266,2989,"The angular-seed app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in @abstr_hyperlink . These tests are run with the @abstr_hyperlink End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.    * the configuration is found at e @abstr_number e-tests/protractor-conf.js   * the end-to-end tests are found in e @abstr_number e-tests/scenarios.js    Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can interact with it.  @abstr_code_section  In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this. The angular-seed project comes with a predefined script to do this:  @abstr_code_section  This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.  Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:  @abstr_code_section  This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the development server.  Note: Under the hood, Protractor uses the @abstr_hyperlink , which in turn requires the @abstr_hyperlink to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running java -version from the command line.  If JDK is not already installed, you can download it @abstr_hyperlink .  "
266,2990,Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the project. Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.  You can update the tool dependencies by running:  @abstr_code_section  This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the package.json file.  You can update the Angular dependencies by running:  @abstr_code_section  This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the bower.json file.  
266,2991,The angular-seed project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously. The special index-async.html is designed to support this style of loading. For it to work you must inject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page. The project has a predefined script to help do this.  @abstr_code_section  This will copy the contents of the angular-loader.js library file into the index-async.html page. You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using.  
266,2992,"While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr, etc to function properly when an html page is opened via file:// scheme instead of http://.  "
266,2993,"The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver. It is a node.js tool called @abstr_hyperlink . You can start this webserver with npm start but you may choose to install the tool globally:  @abstr_code_section  Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:  @abstr_code_section  Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just configure your server to serve the files under the app/ directory.  "
266,2994,"This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the app/ directory. Everything else should be omitted.  Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.  If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and webserver(s).  "
266,2995, 
266,2996,"@abstr_hyperlink is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The angular-seed project contains a Travis configuration file, .travis.yml, which will cause Travis to run your tests when you push to GitHub.  You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the Travis website for more instruction on how to do this.  "
266,2997,"CloudBees have provided a CI/deployment setup:  @abstr_hyperlink  If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo, along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.  "

270,3021,"Welcome to the JavaScript functions lab! You'll notice a few new things in this lesson that we haven't encountered before. Don't worry, we'll walk you through them.  Even if you've walked through some of this material before, it's a good idea to review as we code-along — we're writing functions now, after all.  "
270,3022,"For now, open up index.js in your text editor. You should see, well, nothing. We'll fix that soon.  Now open up test/index-test.js. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff doing?  At the very top of the file, you'll see  @abstr_code_section  This might be a bit bewildering, but all we're doing is referencing different _libraries_ that help us run your tests. A library is code that someone else (usually multiple someone elses) wrote for our use. Note that require won't work out of the box in the browser. We're actually running our tests in a different _environment_. (Remember the sandbox analogy from earlier? It's just like that.)  If you go to test/index-test.js, you'll see  @abstr_code_section  describe is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using @abstr_hyperlink ) — it's basically a container for our tests.  Let's take a closer look at that describe():  @abstr_code_section  These internal describe() calls are used for _describing_ the functions that you're going to write. In this case, the test is saying, ""Okay, I think there's going to be a function called shout, and it should take one argument (it doesn't actually matter what the argument is called, but string, is nice and specific, don't you think?). It should _return_ that argument in all caps.  Finally, we have  @abstr_code_section  which says that it _expects_ a call to shout() with the string 'hello' will equal the string 'HELLO'. This is the actual test — otherwise called a spec, expectation, or assertion — for this function. We can have more than one test per function, but let's start with this one.  "
270,3023,"To run the tests, run learn test in the terminal in your Learn IDE. The first output you'll see will look like  @abstr_image  Hm, that's kind of disappointing. Let's see if we can get that first test to pass. Open up index.js.  When we write our code, we follow the guidance of the tests. Remember the line, describe('shout(string)', () => { ... }). Well, we know that we need a function called shout that accepts an argument — let's add that first. In index.js:  @abstr_code_section  And what should that function do? Well, the it() description tells us that it ""receives one argument and returns it in all caps"".  Okay, so with that information, we know that our function should look like  @abstr_code_section  But how do we make string all caps? JavaScript has a method for that! It's called toUpperCase(). We can call it on any string:  @abstr_code_section  So let's try it with our shout() function:  @abstr_code_section  And run our tests again:  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_image  Hey! We got one to pass!  "
270,3024,"Now it's your turn to get the rest of the tests to pass. Note that some of them require you to use console.log() instead of return — follow the guidance of the tests!  In this lab, we're writing functions that ""speak"" at different volumes — they whisper or they shout. We're going to use what we learn practicing speaking in this way to write another function, sayHiToGrandma(), which takes our new-found speaking ability to greet our grandmother. She's not exactly deaf, but whispering can be a bit difficult. But she'll always hear you if you say, ""I love you, Grandma.""  Note that just like .toUpperCase() changes any string to all uppercase in JavaScript, .toLowerCase() (e.g., 'HELLO'.toLowerCase()) changes any string to all lowercase.  Additionally, how do we check if a string is all lowercase or all uppercase?  @abstr_code_section  We can simply check whether the string is the same when we convert it to uppercase or lowercase! If it's the same, then it was already in that case; if not, then it's either in the other case or it's mixed case.  Good luck! When you're finished, be sure to run learn submit!

271,3026,"@abstr_hyperlink is a company that makes some pretty amazing high-speed video cameras, which generally have the word Phantom in their name. Their products run the gamut from doing @abstr_hyperlink at @abstr_number frames per second (fps) with the @abstr_hyperlink , all the way to an unbelievable @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number (yes, @abstr_number . @abstr_number _million_ ) fps (though at a mere @abstr_number x @abstr_number _pixels_ , no M, no K) on the @abstr_hyperlink -- with, of course, a whole breadth of in-between speeds and resolutions, including some pretty impressive frame-rates at @abstr_hyperlink on some models (e.g. @abstr_number , @abstr_number fps on the @abstr_hyperlink , to name but one).  This project, then, is an attempt to have a set of open-source utilities for getting data out of the proprietary (though publicly documented) ""CINE"" files. There are, of course, a number of software packages out there already that will read these files, including the ones from Vision Research, other tools from @abstr_hyperlink , and others, but I was unable to find an open-source/free-software one, so... here is this (though note the See Also; I've since discovered other projects doing similar things).  The cameras are fairly expensive, so I imagine their availability is limited. Still, there seem to be more and more people shooting with them (as evidenced by a @abstr_hyperlink ; I got @abstr_number results as of @abstr_number - @abstr_number - @abstr_number , and over @abstr_number million as of @abstr_number - @abstr_number - @abstr_number ). Add to this the fact that I happen to occassionaly have had access to one, and I have some files here that I want to read, so, here we are.  "
271,3027,"These tools are currently in their _infancy_.  Please keep your expectations low for this software, for now.  That said, cineinfo is starting to provide some vaguely-useful information about a CINE file, and cine-extract will now generate a series of PPM files (in cine-extract.d by default; changeable with -d option) from one, one per frame.  There's also a ""magic"" file (a la /etc/magic). I haven't yet taken the time to figure out how one would go about installing it on one's system, but you can run file -M magic foo.cine and it will give some info. Probably still needs more content there, and probably also needs to have some of it removed (or migrated to 'magic.verbose' or something), as the output is really verbose at the moment.  "
271,3028,"This tooling is based on documentation which, at the time of this writing, was available for public download at either of:    * @abstr_hyperlink (original version used, dated @abstr_number )   * @abstr_hyperlink (updated version -- dated @abstr_number , found @abstr_number )    "

272,3035,"Recurrent Neural Network captions your images. Now much faster and better than the original @abstr_hyperlink . Compared to the original NeuralTalk this implementation is batched, uses Torch, runs on a GPU, and supports CNN finetuning. All of these together result in quite a large increase in training speed for the Language Model (~ @abstr_number x), but overall not as much because we also have to forward a VGGNet. However, overall very good models can be trained in @abstr_number - @abstr_number days, and they show a much better performance.  This is an early code release that works great but is slightly hastily released and probably requires some code reading of inline comments (which I tried to be quite good with in general).

Phew! Quite a few dependencies, sorry no easy way around it :\  "
272,3039,"In this case you want to run the evaluation script on a pretrained model checkpoint. I trained a decent one on the @abstr_hyperlink that you can run on your images. The pretrained checkpoint can be downloaded here: @abstr_hyperlink ( @abstr_number MB). It's large because it contains the weights of a finetuned VGGNet. Now place all your images of interest into a folder, e.g. blah, and run the eval script:  @abstr_code_section  This tells the eval script to run up to @abstr_number images from the given folder. If you have a big GPU you can speed up the evaluation by increasing batch_size (default = @abstr_number ). Use -num_images - @abstr_number to process all images. The eval script will create an vis.json file inside the vis folder, which can then be visualized with the provided HTML interface:  @abstr_code_section  Now visit localhost: @abstr_number in your browser and you should see your predicted captions.  You can see an @abstr_hyperlink .  ""I only have CPU"". Okay, in that case download the @abstr_hyperlink . Make sure you run the eval script with -gpuid - @abstr_number to tell the script to run on CPU. On my machine it takes a bit less than @abstr_number second per image to caption in CPU mode.  Beam Search. Beam search is enabled by default because it increases the performance of the search for argmax decoding sequence. However, this is a little more expensive, so if you'd like to evaluate images faster, but at a cost of performance, use -beam_size @abstr_number. For example, in one of my experiments beam size @abstr_number gives CIDEr @abstr_number . @abstr_number , and beam size @abstr_number gives CIDEr @abstr_number . @abstr_number .  Running on MSCOCO images. If you train on MSCOCO (see how below), you will have generated preprocessed MSCOCO images, which you can use directly in the eval script. In this case simply leave out the image_folder option and the eval script and instead pass in the input_h @abstr_number, input_json to your preprocessed files. This will make more sense once you read the section below :)  "
272,3040,"Great, first we need to some preprocessing. Head over to the coco/ folder and run the IPython notebook to download the dataset and do some very simple preprocessing. The notebook will combine the train/val data together and create a very simple and small json file that contains a large list of image paths, and raw captions for each image, of the form:  @abstr_code_section  Once we have this, we're ready to invoke the prepro.py script, which will read all of this in and create a dataset (an hdf @abstr_number file and a json file) ready for consumption in the Lua code. For example, for MS COCO we can run the prepro file as follows:  @abstr_code_section  This is telling the script to read in all the data (the images and the captions), allocate @abstr_number images for val/test splits respectively, and map all words that occur <= @abstr_number times to a special UNK token. The resulting json and h @abstr_number files are about @abstr_number GB and contain everything we want to know about the dataset.  Warning : the prepro script will fail with the default MSCOCO data because one of their images is corrupted. See @abstr_hyperlink for the fix, it involves manually replacing one image in the dataset.  The last thing we need is the @abstr_hyperlink , (under Models section, "" @abstr_number -layer model"" bullet point). Put the two files (the prototxt configuration file and the proto binary of weights) somewhere (e.g. a model directory), and we're ready to train!  @abstr_code_section  The train script will take over, and start dumping checkpoints into the folder specified by checkpoint_path (default = current folder). You also have to point the train script to the VGGNet protos (see the options inside train.lua).  If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use -language_eval @abstr_number option, but don't forget to download the @abstr_hyperlink into coco-caption directory.  A few notes on training. To give you an idea, with the default settings one epoch of MS COCO images is about @abstr_number iterations. @abstr_number epoch of training (with no finetuning - notice this is the default) takes about @abstr_number hour and results in validation loss ~ @abstr_number . @abstr_number and CIDEr score of ~ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . By iteration @abstr_number , @abstr_number CIDEr climbs up to about @abstr_number . @abstr_number (validation loss at about @abstr_number . @abstr_number ) and then will top out at a bit below @abstr_number . @abstr_number CIDEr. After that additional improvements are only possible by turning on CNN finetuning. I like to do the training in stages, where I first train with no finetuning, and then restart the train script with -finetune_cnn_after @abstr_number to start finetuning right away, and using -start_from flag to continue from the previous model checkpoint. You'll see your score rise up to about @abstr_number . @abstr_number CIDEr over ~ @abstr_number days or so (on MS COCO).  "
272,3041,"No problem, create a json file in the exact same form as before:  @abstr_code_section  and invoke the prepro.py script to preprocess all the images and data into and hdf @abstr_number file and json file. Then invoke train.lua (see detailed options inside code).  "
272,3042,"Use the script convert_checkpoint_gpu_to_cpu.lua to convert your GPU checkpoints to be usable on CPU. See inline documentation for why this separate script is needed. For example:  @abstr_code_section  write the file gpu_checkpoint.t @abstr_number _cpu.t @abstr_number, which you can now run with -gpuid - @abstr_number in the eval script.  "

277,3093,@abstr_number . Understand what OAuth is and why we use it. @abstr_number . Use OAuth with the Foursquare API.  
277,3094,We're going to expand on our Coffee Shop example to use OAuth with the Foursquare API to perform actions on behalf of an individual user.  
277,3095,"Until now, we've been authenticating to APIs at the _application_ level using a Client ID/Secret pair with each request.  As we learned, this level of application authentication is important in that it allows the API provider to ensure good behavior by any client application.  Application-level authentication like this gives us access to application-level functions, for instance, venue search. This is an application-level function because you don't need to be any particular user to search for a coffee shop. In fact, if we look at the @abstr_hyperlink API documentation, we see an entry: Requires Acting User: No at the top.  Compare that to the documentation for @abstr_hyperlink , and we see that this function does require an acting user, which makes sense, because the application doesn't have friends, an individual user does.  So, if we want to show our user what their friends are doing, we need a way of authenticating the user to Foursquare through our application.  It's not enough for a user to be logged in to Foursquare and use our app, because Foursquare needs to know that we are acting on _behalf_ of a user and that the user has _allowed_ that action.  We could write some code to log in on behalf of the user, but that would require us to ask the user for their Foursquare login credentials. Think about that as if you're the user. Are you going to give some random website your login and password for Foursquare? The very thought should make you very suspicious of our motives.  @abstr_image  Beyond the security issues, there's the problem of keeping things up to date. If we ask the user to log in to Foursquare on every request, that's a horrible experience.  However, if we store the user's Foursquare login info, we have whole other problems.  The first is that we'd have to store them unencrypted, in plain text, because Fourquare expects a person to log in with their unencrypted credentials. So we have another security problem. Now we have a database full of unencrypted Foursquare credentials waiting for anyone to get in there and grab them all.  Beyond the security issue is a logistical one. If the user changes her password on Foursquare, we'll never know about it, and our app will break. Now she has to update her Foursquare credentials in _two_ places, which is cumbersome to say the least.  "
277,3096,"Okay, how do we authenticate a user without them entering their username and password into our application? @abstr_hyperlink .  OAuth provides a way for one application to authenticate to another on behalf of a user by means of a revokable, expirable _token_. If our application has a Foursquare token for the user, and someone gets access to our database of tokens, all of them can be revoked and a hacker never gets access to individual user credentials.  An OAuth token also provides a standard way for our application to tell Foursquare ""hey, this user says we can do things for her"", because part of implementing OAuth requires the user to take action on the provider (Foursquare, in this case), explicitly authorizing our application.  "
277,3097,"OAuth authentication workflow involved three steps at a high level.  @abstr_number . Request access from the provider site (often via redirect to a special form) @abstr_number . Redirect back to our site with a code @abstr_number . Request a token from the provider using the code  Take a look at the @abstr_hyperlink , specifically the second subsection, under Code (preferred). It describes how to do those three steps with Foursquare.  "
277,3098,"The first thing we want to do is figure out if a user has already authenticated to Foursquare in this session.  Ultimately, users will be considered ""logged in"" if they have an access token stored in their session. So, let's create a private method #logged_in? in your ApplicationController that will return false if session[:token] is nil and true otherwise:  @abstr_code_section  "
277,3099, 
277,3100,"The first step in the OAuth flow is to direct the user to Foursquare to request access if we haven't already.  According to the @abstr_hyperlink , that URL looks like this:  @abstr_code_section  Part of our URL includes passing a redirect_uri parameter, so we'll need to set that up. Update your @abstr_hyperlink and add a Redirect URI. Let's set it to http://localhost: @abstr_number /auth and save the app.  Because we're going to be using our client ID/secret a lot, instead of always typing it in, let's use a .env @abstr_hyperlink to hold our FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID and FOURSQUARE_SECRET values. Once that's set up, we'll be able to access these values as ENV['FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID'] and ENV['FOURSQUARE_SECRET'], which is much easier to keep track of. Follow the instructions to set up Dotenv and add your app's client ID and secret. Don't forget to restart your server after you change any values in .env!  Top-tip: Dotenv is a great way to keep configuration variables for development, but always remember to add .env to your .gitignore so you don't share your secrets with everyone else!  Okay, that should handle everything we need to make this first request, so now we need to set up the redirect.  Write another private method #authenticate_user that will redirect the user to https://foursquare.com/oauth @abstr_number /authenticate _if_ the user is not already logged in. Then we'll set up a before_action to check authentication.  @abstr_code_section  Once you've implemented #authenticate_user, set the authentication as a before_action in your ApplicationController. In your SessionsController, skip the before_action with skip_before_action :authenticate_user, only: :create. Now, whenever users do not have an access token stored in their session, they will be redirected to the Foursquare authorization URL.  Let's try it out. Start your Rails server and try to hit the /search page. You should get redirected to Foursquare! Hit the ""Allow"" button and let's see what happens.  Error. Okay. That's good.

277,3102,"When you registered your application, you set your redirect URL to http://localhost: @abstr_number /auth. This is where Foursquare is sending users after the login process. Now we need to handle that request.  In your routes.rb file, add a route for get '/auth', to: 'sessions#create'. This will route that redirect to our SessionsController and a create action, which is where we'll get the token. So now let's implement that.  "
277,3103,"Back to our handy @abstr_hyperlink ! Foursquare redirects users with a code that can be accessed through params and exchanged for an access token with a second GET request. We'll need to provide our ID, secret, and the code we just got.  We're going to use @abstr_hyperlink to send this request in our controller action. If all goes well, according to the docs we can expect a JSON response with an access_token, so we'll parse that and put it in our session[:token].  @abstr_code_section  Top-tip: Make sure to skip the authenticate_user before_action when you're creating a session, otherwise you'll end up in an infinite loop of trying to figure out who the user is, which is a very existential bug.

277,3105,"Now that users have their API tokens, they can make calls to all of the API endpoints as long as those tokens are included in the request. Back in our @abstr_hyperlink , under the Requests section, we see that all we have to do now is add a oauth_token parameter to any request with the user's token.  Let's look again at the @abstr_hyperlink documentation and add a friends list to our application. First, let's add a route to /friends:  @abstr_code_section  And then handle that in our controller:  @abstr_code_section  Top-tip: Like many API providers, Foursquare gives you a way to try API calls right from the documentation. Try it with the @abstr_hyperlink to examine the response JSON.

279,3124,"To begin using this module, use the Puppet Module Tool (PMT) from the command line to install this module:  puppet module install puppet-splunk  This will place the module into your primary module path if you do not utilize the --target-dir directive.  You can also use r @abstr_number k or code-manager to deploy the module so ensure that you have the correct entry in your Puppetfile.

282,3212,"@abstr_hyperlink  In this lab, you will continue exploring transfer learning. You've already explored feature extraction with AlexNet and TensorFlow. Next, you will use Keras to explore feature extraction with the VGG, Inception and ResNet architectures. The models you will use were trained for days or weeks on the @abstr_hyperlink . Thus, the weights encapsulate higher-level features learned from training on thousands of classes.  We'll use two datasets in this lab:  @abstr_number . German Traffic Sign Dataset @abstr_number . Cifar @abstr_number  Unless you have a powerful GPU, running feature extraction on these models will take a significant amount of time. To make things we precomputed bottleneck features for each (network, dataset) pair, this will allow you experiment with feature extraction even on a modest CPU. You can think of bottleneck features as feature extraction but with caching. Because the base network weights are frozen during feature extraction, the output for an image will always be the same. Thus, once the image has already been passed once through the network we can cache and reuse the output.  The files are encoded as such:    * {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_train.p   * {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_validation.p    network can be one of 'vgg', 'inception', or 'resnet'  dataset can be on of 'cifar @abstr_number ' or 'traffic'  How will the pretrained model perform on the new datasets?

290,3313,"Special builds can be created that exclude subsets of jQuery functionality. This allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jQuery are not being used. For example, an app that only used JSONP for $.ajax() and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax/xhr modules.  Any module may be excluded except for core, and selector. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the src folder (without the .js extension).  Some example modules that can be excluded are:    * ajax : All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart().   * ajax/xhr : The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.   * ajax/script : The <script> AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.   * ajax/jsonp : The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.   * css : The .css() method. Also removes all modules depending on css (including effects , dimensions , and offset ).   * css/showHide : Non-animated .show(), .hide() and .toggle(); can be excluded if you use classes or explicit .css() calls to set the display property. Also removes the effects module.   * deprecated : Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.   * dimensions : The .width() and .height() methods, including inner- and outer- variations.   * effects : The .animate() method and its shorthands such as .slideUp() or .hide(""slow"").   * event : The .on() and .off() methods and all event functionality. Also removes event/alias.   * event/alias : All event attaching/triggering shorthands like .click() or .mouseover().   * event/focusin : Cross-browser support for the focusin and focusout events.   * event/trigger : The .trigger() and .triggerHandler() methods. Used by alias and focusin modules.   * offset : The .offset(), .position(), .offsetParent(), .scrollLeft(), and .scrollTop() methods.   * wrap : The .wrap(), .wrapAll(), .wrapInner(), and .unwrap() methods.   * core/ready : Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with jQuery() will simply be called immediately. However, jQuery(document).ready() will not be a function and .on(""ready"", ...) or similar will not be triggered.   * deferred : Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also removes jQuery.Callbacks. _Note_ that modules that depend on jQuery.Deferred(AJAX, effects, core/ready) will not be removed and will still expect jQuery.Deferred to be there. Include your own jQuery.Deferred implementation or exclude those modules as well (grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready).   * exports/global : Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.   * exports/amd : Exclude the AMD definition.    As a special case, you may also replace Sizzle by using a special flag grunt custom:-sizzle.    * sizzle : The Sizzle selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's querySelectorAll method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the @abstr_hyperlink file for details.    _Note_ : Excluding Sizzle will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as effects/animatedSelector and css/hiddenVisibleSelectors).  The build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes or includes.  "
290,3314,"As an option, you can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to ""jquery"", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Simply set the ""amd"" option:  @abstr_code_section  Or, to define anonymously, set the name to an empty string.  @abstr_code_section  "

Then, make sure all Node dependencies are installed:  @abstr_code_section  Create the custom build using the grunt custom option, listing the modules to be excluded.  Exclude all ajax functionality:  @abstr_code_section  Excluding css removes modules depending on CSS: effects , offset , dimensions.  @abstr_code_section  Exclude a bunch of modules:  @abstr_code_section  For questions or requests regarding custom builds, please start a thread on the @abstr_hyperlink section of the forum. Due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds, they are not regularly tested in jQuery's unit test process.

The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by including the ""/test/data/iframeTest.js"" script and calling startIframeTest( [ additional args ] ) when appropriate. Often this will be after either document ready or window.onload fires.

You almost never need to update create-react-app itself: it delegates all the setup to react-scripts.  When you run create-react-app, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.  To update an existing project to a new version of react-scripts, @abstr_hyperlink , find the version you’re currently on (check package.json in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.  In most cases bumping the react-scripts version in package.json and running npm install in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the @abstr_hyperlink for potential breaking changes.

You can delete or rename the other files.  You may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack. You need to put any JS and CSS files insidesrc, or Webpack won’t see them.  Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.

Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.  They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.  You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.  > A note for Atomlinter-eslint users  > If you are using the Atom linter-eslint plugin, make sure that Use global ESLint installation option is checked:  > @abstr_image  > For Visual Studio Code users  > VS Code ESLint plugin automatically detects Create React App's configuration file. So you do not need to create eslintrc.json at the root directory, except when you want to add your own rules. In that case, you should include CRA's config by adding this line:  > @abstr_code_section  Then add this block to the package.json file of your project:  @abstr_code_section  Finally, you will need to install some packages _globally_ :  @abstr_code_section  We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already @abstr_hyperlink so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.   "
294,3374,"This feature is currently only supported by @abstr_hyperlink editor.  Visual Studio Code supports live-editing and debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.  You would need to have the latest version of @abstr_hyperlink and VS Code @abstr_hyperlink installed.  Then add the block below to your launch.json file and put it inside the .vscode folder in your app’s root directory.  @abstr_code_section  Start your app by running npm start, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing F @abstr_number or by clicking the green debug icon.

294,3375,"You can find the source HTML file in the public folder of the generated project. You may edit the <title> tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.  Note that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the public folder very often. For example, adding a stylesheet is done without touching the HTML.  If you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser @abstr_hyperlink API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use @abstr_hyperlink , a third party library.  If you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in this section. Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered here.  "

294,3379,"@abstr_code_section  Be aware of the @abstr_hyperlink . It is a common source of mistakes.  We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use export default Button and import Button from './Button'.  Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.  Learn more about ES @abstr_number modules:    * @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink    "
294,3380,"This project setup uses @abstr_hyperlink for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of import beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to import the CSS from the JavaScript file :  "
294,3381,@abstr_code_section  
294,3382,"@abstr_code_section  This is not required for React but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach @abstr_hyperlink . However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.  In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified .css file in the build output.  If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into src/index.css. It would still be imported from src/index.js, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.  "
294,3383,"This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through @abstr_hyperlink so you don’t need to worry about it.  For example, this:  @abstr_code_section  becomes this:  @abstr_code_section  If you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, @abstr_hyperlink .  "
294,3384,"Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a .Button CSS class in <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> components, we recommend creating a <Button> component with its own .Button styles, that both <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> can render (but @abstr_hyperlink ).  Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.  First, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:  @abstr_code_section  Then in package.json, add the following lines to scripts:  @abstr_code_section  > Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace build-css and watch-css commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.  Now you can rename src/App.css to src/App.scss and run npm run watch-css. The watcher will find every Sass file in src subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting src/App.css. Since src/App.js still imports src/App.css, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit src/App.scss, and src/App.css will be regenerated.  To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, src/App.scss and other component style files could include @import ""./shared.scss""; with variable definitions.  At this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add src/**/*.css to your .gitignore file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.  As a final step, you may find it convenient to run watch-css automatically with npm start, and run build-css as a part of npm run build. You can use the && operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:  @abstr_code_section  Then we can change start and build scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:  @abstr_code_section  Now running npm start and npm run build also builds Sass files. Note that node-sass seems to have an @abstr_hyperlink so you might need to restart the watcher when you create a file until it’s resolved.  "
294,3385,"With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.  You can import an image right in a JavaScript module. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.  Here is an example:  @abstr_code_section  This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.  This works in CSS too:  @abstr_code_section  Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.  Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.  It is not required for React but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images). An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.  "

294,3387,"The public folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title. The <script> tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.  "
294,3388,"You can also add other assets to the public folder.  Note that we normally encourage you to import assets in JavaScript files instead. For example, see the sections on adding a stylesheet and adding images and fonts. This mechanism provides a number of benefits:    * Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.   * Missing files cause compilation errors instead of @abstr_number errors for your users.   * Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.    However there is an escape hatch that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.  If you put a file into the public folder, it will not be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the public folder, you need to use a special variable called PUBLIC_URL.  Inside index.html, you can use it like this:  @abstr_code_section  Only files inside the public folder will be accessible by %PUBLIC_URL% prefix. If you need to use a file from src or node_modules, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.  When you run npm run build, Create React App will substitute %PUBLIC_URL% with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.  In JavaScript code, you can use process.env.PUBLIC_URL for similar purposes:  @abstr_code_section  Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:    * None of the files in public folder get post-processed or minified.   * Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause @abstr_number errors for your users.   * Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.    "
294,3389,"Normally we recommend importing stylesheets, images, and fonts from JavaScript. The public folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:    * You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as @abstr_hyperlink .   * You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.   * You want to include a small script like @abstr_hyperlink outside of the bundled code.   * Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a <script> tag.    Note that if you add a <script> that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.  "
294,3390,"When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.  You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the window object, for example:  @abstr_code_section  This makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.  Alternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding // eslint-disable-line after it.  "
294,3391,"You don’t have to use @abstr_hyperlink together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:  Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:  @abstr_code_section  Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your src/index.js file:  @abstr_code_section  Import required React Bootstrap components within src/App.js file or your custom component files:  @abstr_code_section  Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example @abstr_hyperlink redone using React Bootstrap.  "
294,3392,"Sometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package). We suggest the following approach:    * Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.   * Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.   * Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.    Here is an example of adding a @abstr_hyperlink that follows these steps.

Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By default you will have NODE_ENV defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with REACT_APP_.  The environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like described here. Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.  > Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_. Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally @abstr_hyperlink . Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.  These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE.  There is also a special built-in environment variable called NODE_ENV. You can read it from process.env.NODE_ENV. When you run npm start, it is always equal to 'development', when you run npm test it is always equal to 'test', and when you run npm run build to make a production bundle, it is always equal to 'production'. You cannot overrideNODE_ENV manually. This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.  These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.  First, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined in the environment inside a <form>:  @abstr_code_section  During the build, process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE will be replaced with the current value of the REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE environment variable. Remember that the NODE_ENV variable will be set for you automatically.  When you load the app in the browser and inspect the <input>, you will see its value set to abcdef, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using npm start:  @abstr_code_section  The above form is looking for a variable called REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE from the environment. In order to consume this value, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in a .env file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.  Having access to the NODE_ENV is also useful for performing actions conditionally:  @abstr_code_section  When you compile the app with npm run build, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.   "
294,3395," Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and higher.  You can also access the environment variables starting with REACT_APP_ in the public/index.html. For example:  @abstr_code_section  Note that the caveats from the above section apply:    * Apart from a few built-in variables (NODE_ENV and PUBLIC_URL), variable names must start with REACT_APP_ to work.   * The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, follow this approach instead.     "

People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation. For example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:  @abstr_code_section  Such setup is not required. However, if you do have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like fetch('/api/todos') without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.  To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a proxy field to your package.json, for example:  @abstr_code_section  This way, when you fetch('/api/todos') in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to http://localhost: @abstr_number /api/todos as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a text/html accept header to the proxy.  Conveniently, this avoids @abstr_hyperlink and error messages like this in development:  @abstr_code_section  Keep in mind that proxy only has effect in development (with npm start), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like /api/todos point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the /api prefix. Any unrecognized request without a text/html accept header will be redirected to the specified proxy.  The proxy option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections. If the proxy option is not flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:    * Enable CORS on your server ( @abstr_hyperlink ).   * Use environment variables to inject the right server host and port into your app.     "

294,3408,"Since Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make <meta> tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:  @abstr_code_section  Then, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read index.html into memory and replace __OG_TITLE__, __OG_DESCRIPTION__, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!  If you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.  "
294,3409,"If you’re hosting your build with a static hosting provider you can use @abstr_hyperlink to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.  There are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.  The primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.  You can read more about @abstr_hyperlink .  "
294,3410,"Similarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:  @abstr_code_section  Then, on the server, you can replace __SERVER_DATA__ with a JSON of real data right before sending the response.

To prepare for this integration, we did a @abstr_hyperlink of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.  Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.  While Jest provides browser globals such as window thanks to @abstr_hyperlink , they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.  We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.   "
294,3412,"Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:    * Files with .js suffix in __tests__ folders.   * Files with .test.js suffix.   * Files with .spec.js suffix.    The .test.js / .spec.js files (or the __tests__ folders) can be located at any depth under the src top level folder.  We recommend to put the test files (or __tests__ folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if App.test.js and App.js are in the same folder, the test just needs to import App from './App' instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.  "
294,3413,"When you run npm test, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like npm start recompiles the code.  The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:  @abstr_image  "
294,3414,"By default, when you run npm test, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests runs fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.  Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press a in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.  Jest will always run all tests on a continuous integration server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.  "
294,3415,"To create tests, add it() (or test()) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in describe() blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.  Jest provides a built-in expect() global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:  @abstr_code_section  All expect() matchers supported by Jest are @abstr_hyperlink . You can also use @abstr_hyperlink to create “spies” or mock functions.  "
294,3416,"There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.  Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:  @abstr_code_section  This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in src/App.test.js.  When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.  If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using @abstr_hyperlink from @abstr_hyperlink . You can write a smoke test with it too:  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_code_section  Unlike the previous smoke test using ReactDOM.render(), this test only renders <App> and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if <App> itself renders a <Button> that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports @abstr_hyperlink , and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.  You can read the @abstr_hyperlink for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in expect() and jest.fn() for spies.  Here is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:  @abstr_code_section  All Jest matchers are @abstr_hyperlink . Nevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like @abstr_hyperlink if you want to, as described below.  Additionally, you might find @abstr_hyperlink helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above contains code can be written simpler with jest-enzyme.  @abstr_code_section  To setup jest-enzyme with Create React App, follow the instructions for initializing your test environment to import jest-enzyme.  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_code_section  "

However, if you are used to other libraries, such as @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink , or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:  @abstr_code_section  and then use them in your tests like you normally do.

Run npm test -- --coverage (note extra -- in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:  @abstr_image  Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.  
294,3422,"By default npm test runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called CI.  When creating a build of your application with npm run build linter warnings are not checked by default. Like npm test, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable CI. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.  Popular CI servers already set the environment variable CI by default but you can do this yourself too:  "

The build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.  "
294,3428,"By default, the package.json of the generated project looks like this:  @abstr_code_section  If you know that none of your tests depend on @abstr_hyperlink , you can safely remove --env=jsdom, and your tests will run faster.

"
294,3429,"Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. @abstr_hyperlink  "
294,3430,"If you use @abstr_hyperlink , there is a @abstr_hyperlink which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.  @abstr_image  "
294,3431,"Usually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states. For an example, a simple button component could have following states:    * With a text label.   * With an emoji.   * In the disabled mode.    Usually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.  Create React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add @abstr_hyperlink to your project. It is a third-party tool that lets you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app.  @abstr_image  You can also deploy your Storybook as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.  Here’s how to setup your app with Storybook:  First, install the following npm package globally:  @abstr_code_section  Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:  @abstr_code_section  After that, follow the instructions on the screen.  Learn more about React Storybook:    * Screencast: @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink   * @abstr_hyperlink with React Storybook    "
294,3432,You can turn your React app into a @abstr_hyperlink by following the steps in @abstr_hyperlink .  
294,3433,"npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.  "
294,3434,"For environments using @abstr_hyperlink , the easiest way to handle this would be to install @abstr_hyperlink and let it handle the rest:  @abstr_code_section  The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port _* @abstr_number *_. Like many of @abstr_hyperlink ’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -p or --port flags.  Run this command to get a full list of the options available:  @abstr_code_section  "
294,3435,"You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.  Here’s a programmatic example using @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.  The build folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.  However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like /todos/ @abstr_number in your single-page app.  "
294,3436,"If you use routers that use the HTML @abstr_number @abstr_hyperlink under the hood (for example, @abstr_hyperlink with browserHistory), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for /todos/ @abstr_number, the development server will respond to localhost: @abstr_number /todos/ @abstr_number properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.  This is because when there is a fresh page load for a /todos/ @abstr_number, the server looks for the file build/todos/ @abstr_number and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to /todos/ @abstr_number by serving index.html. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve index.html for any unknown paths:  @abstr_code_section  If you’re using @abstr_hyperlink , you need to create a .htaccess file in the public folder that looks like this:  @abstr_code_section  It will get copied to the build folder when you run npm run build.  Now requests to /todos/ @abstr_number will be handled correctly both in development and in production.  "
294,3437,"By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root. To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json, for example:  @abstr_code_section  This will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.  "
294,3438," Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and higher.  If you are not using the HTML @abstr_number pushState history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your package.json:  @abstr_code_section  This will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to index.html. You will then be able to move your app from http://mywebsite.com to http://mywebsite.com/relativepath or even http://mywebsite.com/relative/path without having to rebuild it.   "
294,3439,See @abstr_hyperlink blog post on how to deploy your React app to @abstr_hyperlink .  
294,3440,"Install the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running npm install -g firebase-tools. Sign up for a @abstr_hyperlink and create a new project. Run firebase login and login with your previous created Firebase account.  Then run the firebase init command from your project’s root. You need to choose the Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step. You will need to agree with database.rules.json being created, choose build as the public directory, and also agree to Configure as a single-page app by replying with y.  @abstr_code_section  Now, after you create a production build with npm run build, you can deploy it by running firebase deploy.  @abstr_code_section  For more information see @abstr_hyperlink .  "
294,3441, Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and higher.   
294,3442,"The step below is important! If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.  Open your package.json and add a homepage field:  @abstr_code_section  Create React App uses the homepage field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.  "
294,3443,"Now, whenever you run npm run build, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.  To publish it at @abstr_hyperlink , run:  @abstr_code_section  Add the following scripts in your package.json:  @abstr_code_section  The predeploy script will run automatically before deploy is run.  "
294,3444,Then run:  @abstr_code_section  
294,3445,"Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the gh-pages branch:  @abstr_image  "
294,3446,You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a CNAME file to the public/ folder.  
294,3447,"GitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML @abstr_number pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router using browserHistory). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/ @abstr_number, where /todos/ @abstr_number is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns @abstr_number because it knows nothing of /todos/ @abstr_number. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:    * You could switch from using HTML @abstr_number history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to hashHistory for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/ @abstr_number ?_k=yknaj). @abstr_hyperlink about different history implementations in React Router.   * Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle @abstr_number by redirecting to your index.html page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a @abstr_number .html file with the redirection code to the build folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to index.html. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique @abstr_hyperlink .    "
294,3448,Use the @abstr_hyperlink . You can find instructions in @abstr_hyperlink .

You can generate this in MD under Tools menu : Insert GUID. we need this to key between articles and their associated samples      * IsFullApplication - Boolean flag (true or false): whether or not this is a full application such as the MWC App, Tasky, etc., or it's just a feature sample, such as, how to use 'x' feature. the basic test here is, if you would submit this to the app store because it's useful, then it's a full app, otherwise it's just a feature sample.      * Brief - Short description or what your sample does. This allows us to display a nice and clean vignette on the sample page.      * Level - Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced: this is the intended audience level for the sample. only the getting started samples are Beginning, as they are intended for people who are _just_ starting with the platform. most samples are Intermediate, and a few, that dive deep into difficult APIs, should be Advanced.      * Minimum License Requirement - Starter, Indie, Business, or Enterprise: denotes the license that a user has to have in order to build/run the sample.      * Tags : a list of relevant tags for the app. These are:      * Data     * Games     * Graphics (CoreDrawing, Animation, OpenGL...)     * Media (Video, Sound, recording, photos)     * Platform Features (Photo Library, Contacts, Calendars, etc.)     * Device Features (NFC, Accelerometer, Compass, Magnemometer, Bluetooth, RFID)     * Cloud (Web Services, Networking, etc.)     * Backgrounding     * Maps + Location     * Binding + Interop (Projections)     * Notifications     * Touch     * Getting Started     * Async     * FSharp      * SupportedPlatforms : this is only for cross plat samples. It's a comma-separated list, and the valid values are iOS, Android, and Windows.      * Gallery : This tag must contain a value of true if you want the sample to show up in the samples gallery on the developer portal.    * Buildable Sln and CSProj file - the project _must_ build and have the appropriate project scaffolding (solution + proj).     A good example of this stuff is here in the drawing sample: @abstr_hyperlink  For a x-platform sample, please see: https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky  "
298,3490,"We integrate tightly with Git to make sure we always provide working samples to our customers. This is achieved through a pre-commit hook that runs before your commit goes through, as well as a post-receive hook on GitHub's end that notifies our samples gallery server when changes go through.  To you, as a sample committer, this means that before you push to the repos, you should run the ""install-hook.bat"" or ""install-hook.sh"" (depending on whether you're on Windows or OS X/Linux, respectively). These will install the Git pre-commit hook. Now, whenever you try to make a Git commit, all samples in the repo will be validated. If any sample fails to validate, the commit is aborted; otherwise, your commit goes through and you can go ahead and push.  This strict approach is put in place to ensure that the samples we present to our customers are always in a good state, and to ensure that all samples integrate correctly with the sample gallery (README.md, Metadata.xml, etc). Note that the master branch of each sample repo is what we present to our customers for our stable releases, so they must _always_ Just Work.  Should you wish to invoke validation of samples manually, simply run ""validate.windows"" or ""validate.posix"" (again, Windows vs OS X/Linux, respectively). These must be run from a Bash shell (i.e. a terminal on OS X/Linux or the Git Bash terminal on Windows).  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! "

300,3499,"@abstr_hyperlink is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine. It builds upon the strengths of Java, but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk. Groovy makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve as well as supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain. Groovy makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL. It also increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications. Groovy simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box. Groovy also seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.  "

312,3598,"Available on @abstr_hyperlink .  Shielded is a full-featured implementation of Software Transactional Memory in .NET. It provides a system (the Shield static class) for running in-memory transactions, and data structures which are aware of transactions. It can also generate transaction-aware proxy subclasses based on a POCO class type. The implementation is strict, with strong guarantees on safety. It is mostly lock-free, using only one major lock which is held during the pre-commit check.  Here is a small example:  @abstr_code_section  Shielded fields are thread-safe. You can read them out of transaction, but changes must be done inside. While inside, the library guarantees a consistent view of all shielded fields.  Another example, the STM version of ""Hello world!"" - parallel addition in an array. Here, in a dictionary:  @abstr_code_section  Shielded works with value types, and the language automatically does the needed cloning. For ref types, it only makes the reference itself transactional. The class should then be immutable, or, if you have a class you want to make transactional:  @abstr_code_section  Then you create instances like this:  @abstr_code_section  The Factory creates a proxy sub-class, using CodeDom, which will have transactional overrides for all virtual properties of the base class that are public or protected. Due to CodeDom limitations, the getter and setter must have the same accessibility! The proxy objects are thread-safe (or, at least their virtual properties are), and can only be changed inside transactions. Usage is simple:  @abstr_code_section  It is safe to execute any number of concurrent transactions that are reading from or writing into the same shielded fields - each transaction will complete correctly. This is accomplished by: * ensuring that in one transaction you read a consistent state of all shielded fields * buffering writes into storage which is local for each thread  Your changes are commited and made visible to other threads only if all the shielded fields you read or wrote into have not changed since you started. If any have new changes, your transaction is retried from the beginning, but this time reading the new data. Though it may seem so, this cannot create an infinite loop since for any conflict to occur at least one transaction must successfully commit. Overall, the system must make progress.  This quality would place Shielded in the lock-free class of non-blocking concurrency mechanisms, according to academic classification. However, this is not accurate since the commit check gets done under a lock. Hence the word ""mostly"" in the short description.  "
312,3599," MVCC : Each transaction reads a consistent snapshot of the state without the need for locking, since updates just create new versions.     * Old versions are dropped soon after no one is capable of reading them any more.   * Read-only transactions always complete without any repetitions and without entering the global lock!   * Strictness : If a write is made anywhere, the system will insist that all touched locations, read or written, still contain the same version of data that they had when the transaction opened. This means it does not suffer from the Write Skew issue.   * Transactional collections : Included in the library are ShieldedDict<> (dictionary), ShieldedSeq<> (singly linked list) and ShieldedTree<> (a red-black tree implementation).     * It is possible to use this library with immutable collections from @abstr_hyperlink .   * Transaction-local storage : ShieldedLocal<> allows storing anything in the transaction context, visible only from within that transaction.   * To perform side-effects (IO, and most other operations which are not shielded) you use the SideEffect method of the Shield class, which takes optional onCommit and onRollback lambdas, or the SyncSideEffect method which allows you to execute code during a commit, while the changed fields are still locked.   * Conditional transactions : Method Shield.Conditional allows you to define something similar to a database AFTER trigger. It receives a test, and an action to perform, both lambdas. It runs the test, makes a note of all shielded objects that the test had accessed, and later re-executes the test when any of those objects is committed into. If test passes, the action is called.     * Implemented transactionally, so can be called from transactions, and can be triggered by the transaction that created it.     * Returns an IDisposable for deactivating the subscription, also transactionally. It may even deactivate itself, e.g. to guarantee one-time execution.   * Pre-commit checks : Shield.PreCommit is very similar to Shield.Conditional, but executes the test within a transaction that changes one of the fields it is interested in, just before that transaction will commit.     * Can be used to ensure certain invariants are held, or to implement thread prioritization by allowing only some threads which access a field to commit into it.   * Custom commit operations : You can integrate your own code into the commit process, to execute while the shielded fields, that are being written, are held locked.     * Already mentioned Shield.SyncSideEffect does this on the level of one transaction.     * Using Shield.WhenCommitting, you subscribe globally for any commit, or based on the type of field being written. These subscriptions should never throw!     * Shield.RunToCommit runs a transaction just up to commit, and allows you to commit/rollback later, or from another thread. This is useful for asynchronous programming.   * Commutables : operations which can be performed without conflict, because they can be reordered in time and have the same net effect, i.e. they are commutable (name borrowed from Clojure). Incrementing an int is an example - if you don’t care what the int’s value is, you can increment it without conflict by simply incrementing whatever value you encounter there at commit time. Using commutes, when appropriate, reduces conflicts and improves concurrency. Incrementing an int, conflict-free:  @abstr_code_section      * Commutes are not performed under any lock, but rather in a special commute subtransaction, which reads the latest data, and tries to commit with the same stamp as your main transaction. If only the commutes fail, then only the commutes get retried.     * If, in the example above, your main transaction has already (or perhaps will later) read the n field or written to it (non-commutatively), the commute “degenerates” - it gets executed in place, in your transaction, and you can see it’s effect. This means consistency - if you read it, it will stay as read when you commit. But, it is now a potential conflict.     * Shield has various commutable operations defined in it. Appending to a sequence is commutable - if you do not touch the seq, it never conflicts. Collection Count fields are comuted over, to avoid unnecessary conflicts.    "

314,3616,"For better organization and encapsulation, the project groups the reporting workflow into two parts: Aw-Report-Model for persistence, entities and the CSV mapping to AdWords information and Aw-Reporting for the logic (API services, downloader and processors).  "
314,3617,"Provides all the necessary classes to persist data and the entities’ mapping to AdWords report data.    * Entities: these POJOs define all the available fields for each report kind as java fields, by using annotations. The Entities contain the information to link the java fields to the report fields definition, the csv display name header fields and the datastore fields.    * CSV: The CSV classes use the OpenCSV library to convert CSV files into Java beans using annotations. The package also contains two new annotations to define the Report Definition Type and the mapping between java field, report’s Column Name and Display Name headers. For example:      * Annotation @CsvReport at the Report class level, for example for ReportAccount: @CsvReport(value= ReportDefinitionReportType.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT) public class ReportAccount extends Report {...      * Annotation @CsvField at the java field level, for example for avgCpm: @CsvField (value = ""Avg. CPM"", reportField = ""AverageCpm"") public BigDecimal avgCpm;    * Persistence: The persistence layer uses Spring for bean management, injection and in class annotations, this helps to clearly demarcate the application layers. AuthTokenPersister: is the interface for the authorization token storage, we have implemented it for Mysql and a MongoDB. ReportEntitiesPersister is the interface for the report entities storage, we have implemented it for Mysql and a MongoDB.     "
314,3618,"Provides the logic (API services, downloader and processors)    * Downloader: Based on MultipleClientReportDownloader java example (it uses the Library ReportDownloader) the Downloader is in charge of downloading all the report files using multiple threads.    * Processors: The ReportProcessor is the class with the main logic, it is responsible for calling the downloader, use the CSV classes for the parsing and call the Persistence helpers for the storage. This class can be replaced by a custom processor by changing the bean component in the projects xml configuration files.    * API Services: Beside the report Downloader calls to AdHoc Reports, the ManagedCustomerDelegate is the only class talking to the AdWords API, it is in charge of getting all the account ids in the MCC tree.    * AwReporting main: The AwReporting main class is in charge of printing the help information, of the properties file example and of passing the command line parameters to the processor for execution.     "
314,3619,"In order to support some report types that are not yet available in the API, but are available in the AdWords Interface, we introduced the feature of importing data to the database directly from CSV files that were downloaded from the interface.  The offline data import works just as the online mode (where the data is downloaded from the API), but skips the download step. All the field mappings and report types supported are still the same, but keep in mind that most of the entity IDs are not available in the reports downloaded from the interface.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Before importing the CSV with AwReporting, you must edit the file and make sure that it's in the same format as the CSV file downloaded from the API: * First line must contain the name or description of the report; * Second line must contain the column names/headers; * Following lines must contain the data.  Usually when you download a report from the interface, the CSV file will contain some additional lines in the beginning of the file. You have to remove those lines before importing it into AwReporting.  To use the offline import data, you just need to specify in the command line the report type that you will import, and the local file that you will use as an addition to the other arguments:  @abstr_code_section  IMPORTANT NOTE: The dates specified are very import, because they will be used to populate the database following the same format as the data downloaded from the API. Date periods _are not supported_.  "
314,3620,"With the offline data import feature available, we added the Video Campaign Performance Report to AwReporting model. This means that it's now possible to download the Video Performance reports from the interface, import it into AwReporting and make the data available in the database.  This report still an experiment, and we want to hear more feedback from users in order to further improve this, and make sure that this is in fact a necessity.  To import video campaign performance reports in AwReport, just run the following command:  @abstr_code_section  IMPORTANT NOTE: The API _does not support_ video campaign reports. This is a work around to import video campaign reports into the database, facilitating the usage of the data in your applications.  "

Similarly for the forum we can know if a user has posted comments, watched a thread etc.  The goal here is to make relevant hypotheses and extract associated features that reflect a learning behaviour. Three features were already extracted in the Python code supplied: the duration of a video activity, the average time difference between two videos watched and the number of forum threads viewed.  __Hypotheses related to video events__ * the time spent watching videos has a positive effect on the next submission grade * --> count the time spent (DurationOfVideoActivity) * the more frequently a user watches a video, the more chances he has to increase his grade * --> extract the duration between two videos watched and compute the mean (AverageVideoTimeDiffs) * the number of different videos watched has a positive effect on the next submission grade * --> count the number of different videos (NumberVideoWatched) * if the learner seeks to specific points in the video lectures, (s)he is actively engaged with the course material * --> count the number of seek events (NumberOfSeekEvents)  __Hypothese related to forum events__ * the number of threads viewed has a positive effect on the next submission grade * --> count the number of thread views (NumberOfThreadViews) * the number of thread created has a positive effect on the next submission grade * --> count the number of thread launched (NumberOfThreadCreated) * the number of comments posted has a positive effect on the next submission grade * --> count the number of comments posted (NumberOfComments) * When a learner upvotes a post or a comment, most likely they found the contet helpful and it helped them solve their problems, this might have a positive effect on the next submission grade. * --> count the number of upvotes for both comments and posts (NumberOfUpvotes)  __Hypothese combining both events (bigrams and trigrams)__ * watching a video followed by posting  __Other hypotheses__ * the time between two submissions should be indicative of the grade difference. A lot of submissions with relatively small time durations between submissions reflect a ""trial and error"" pattern where the learner typically tests some lines of code and wants to see the result by submitting. This behaviour is prone to errors in the code and as such should have a negative effect on the grade. *TODO (probably secondary features for regression task) * --> find out if certain sequences of behavior are good predictors of improvement * --> compute more in-depth representations of what happened on the forum (did someone reply to your forum thread?

You can build the dev track simply by running:       $ ./build.sh dev   The first time this is run, this will download and build all dependencies (except Bazel, of course). This can take a while, so be patient. Don't expect status updates for a minute or two at a time in some cases. Subsequent builds will be extremely fast; Bazel excels at doing incremental builds.  Don't be alarmed if you see a few warnings. In particular, the linker may complain about duplicated symbols.  If successful, Bazel will output something like this:       Target //:mosh_chrome up-to-date:       bazel-genfiles/mosh_chrome_dev.zip   That .zip file contains the entire app. To load it into Chrome, unzip it into a directory on your machine, then go to chrome://extensions, enable ""Developer mode"", and click the ""Load unpacked extension button"", directing it to said directory. Then the app will be launchable from the app screen and the extensions screen.  To distribute the app, build the release track and upload the .zip file to the Chrome Web Store. "

The idea was to demonstrate, through easy-to-follow, well-commented code, how things worked behind the scenes. How does the event loop work? How does type coersion work when comparing two values?  The group of source .js files were created to educate people on how JavaScript worked from the inside out. But beyond that, they were pretty useless... ""unnecesary"", you might say.  With the new project of Node.Unnecesary.js, I take this methodology to the world of node.js. This time, however, the .js files could be of some use to people. The browser doesn't have many of the utility objects and methods available to node users. So I've created the source files with this in mind.  You can require(.js) and use the code as per usual in node, or add a reference to the .js file in a web page, and the ""module"" will be added to the window object, allowing you to use its functionality in your browser-based code.  There are a few small tweaks to how things work so that the module is more useful when used in a browser, for urls and the like.  "

They allow a user to concisely specify her commands and the communications between them (piping, redirecting, &c.). When she needs to do something more complex than running a set of commands with known inputs, however, things become complicated. General programming with sh can be unpleasant and error prone, to say the least.  Scheme is a simple, expressive general programming language. A user with some taste may want to use it to wield her computing machine. For simple commands, however, it is not the most concise. At the scale of the command line, even the overhead of parentheses matters. It would be nice to use each of these languages where their strengths lie.  Scsh is the solution. It allows the user to write commands in a language within Scheme that follows the unix way, but also allows her to specify more complex commands with the elegance of Scheme.  "

339,3838,"This repository houses the code for the OpenCL™ BLAS portion of clMath. The complete set of BLAS level @abstr_number , @abstr_number & @abstr_number routines is implemented. Please see Netlib BLAS for the list of supported routines. In addition to GPU devices, the library also supports running on CPU devices to facilitate debugging and multicore programming. APPML @abstr_number . @abstr_number is the most current generally available pre-packaged binary version of the library available for download for both Linux and Windows platforms.  The primary goal of clBLAS is to make it easier for developers to utilize the inherent performance and power efficiency benefits of heterogeneous computing. clBLAS interfaces do not hide nor wrap OpenCL interfaces, but rather leaves OpenCL state management to the control of the user to allow for maximum performance and flexibility. The clBLAS library does generate and enqueue optimized OpenCL kernels, relieving the user from the task of writing, optimizing and maintaining kernel code themselves.  "
339,3839," Introducing @abstr_hyperlink     * clBLAS's Gemm implementation has been comprehensively overhauled to use AutoGemm. AutoGemm is a suite of python scripts which generate optimized kernels and kernel selection logic, for all precisions, transposes, tile sizes and so on.     * CMake is configured to use AutoGemm for clBLAS so the build and usage experience of Gemm remains unchanged (only performance and maintainability has been improved). Kernel sources are generated at build time (not runtime) and can be configured within CMake to be pre-compiled at build time.     * clBLAS users with unique Gemm requirements can customize AutoGemm to their needs (such as non-default tile sizes for very small or very skinny matrices); see @abstr_hyperlink documentation for details.     "

343,3884,"Experimental bindings to the DOM and other Web APIs.  The bindings are currently undocumented, but as the code mostly just consists of external declarations with type signatures, the code itself is fairly self-documenting. The bindings generally also correspond very well to the Web APIs they bind to, so using MDN along with GitHub should go a long way.  "
343,3885,@abstr_code_section Then add bs-webapi to bs-dependencies in your bsconfig.json. A minimal example: @abstr_code_section  
343,3886,See the @abstr_hyperlink  
343,3887,"The DOM API is mostly organized into interfaces and relies heavily on inheritance. The ergonomics of the API is also heavily dependent on dynamic typing, which makes it somewhat challenging to implement a thin binding layer that is both safe and ergonomic. To achieve this we employ subtyping and implementation inheritance, concepts which aren't very idiomatic to OCaml (or Reason), but all the more beneficial to understand in order to be able to use these bindings effectively.  "
343,3888,"The Dom types, and the relationships between them, are actually defined in the Dom module that ships with bs-platform ( @abstr_hyperlink ), where you'll find a bunch of types that look like this:  @abstr_code_section  This is subtyping implemented with abstract types and phantom arguments. The details of how this works isn't very important (but see @abstr_hyperlink for a detailed explanation of how exactly this trickery works) in order to just use them, but there are a few things you should know:    * If you expand the alias of a concrete DOM type, you'll discover it's actually a list of abstract types. e.g. element expands to _baseClass _element _node _eventTarget_like This means element is a subtype of _element, _node and _eventTarget_like.   * The _like type are ""open"" (because they have a type variable). This means that a function accepting an 'a element_like will accept any ""supertype"" of element_like. A function accepting just an element will only accept an element (Technically element is actually a ""supertype"" of element_like too).    This system works exceptionally well, but has one significant flaw: It makes type errors even more complicated than they normally are. If you know what to look for it's not that bad, but unfortunately the formatting of these errors don't make looking for it any easier. We hope to improve that in other ways (see @abstr_hyperlink )  "
343,3889,"If you've looked through the source code a bit, you've likely come across code like this:  @abstr_code_section  This is the implementation inheritance. Each ""inheritable"" module defines an ""Impl"" module where all its exported functions are defined. include NodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; means that all the functions in NodeRe.Impl should be included in this module, but with the t type of that module replaced by the t type of this one. And that's it, it now has all the functions.  Implementation inheritance is used instead of subtyping to make it easier to understand which functions operate on any given ""subject"". If you have an element and you need to use a function defined in Node, let's say removeChild you cannot just use Node.removeChild. Instead you need to use Element.removeChild, which you can since Element inherits from Node. As a general rule, always use the function in the module corresponding to the type you have. You'll find this makes it very easy to see what types you're dealing with just by reading the code. "

365,4082,"In this lab, we're going to practice writing functions and manipulating numbers in JavaScript. First, though, we need to go over some basic math. In this lab, we're going to learn about various arithmetic operators. What's an operator, you say? It's a symbol that _operates_ on one or more (usually two) objects — + is a good example. The + operator says ""add what's to the left of + and what's to the right of + together."" Easy-peasy!  As you read through this lesson, you're going to be adding your solutions to index.js. You'll write a total of eight functions; use the results of running learn test in your IDE to guide you towards the right function names and functionality.  "
365,4083,"The most fundamental math operations work as one might expect in JavaScript: + adds two numbers; - subtracts one number from another; * multiplies two numbers; and / divides one number by another. For example (as usual, follow along in console!)  @abstr_code_section  At this point, we can fix the first _four_ broken tests: we can define functions add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide() in index.js.  "
365,4084,"Additionally, we can increment (++) and decrement (--) a number if it's assigned to a variable:  @abstr_code_section  We can also put the incrementor and decrementor operations before the number:  @abstr_code_section  But generally, you will see them placed _after_ the number (and we recommend that that's where you put them). If you're interested in the difference, take a look @abstr_hyperlink  And, while we're on the subject, you'll usually only want to use these incrementors and decrementors when the shorthand makes what you're writing easier to read (more on when _exactly_ later). Instead, it's best to use the basic arithmetic operators combined with =. For the examples below, assume that number is equal to @abstr_number (and resets for every example).    * += modifies the value to the operator's left by adding to it the value to the operator's right:  @abstr_code_section    * -= modifies the value to the operator's left by subtracting from it the value to the operator's right:  @abstr_code_section    * *= modifies the value to the operator's left by multiplying it by the value to the operator's right:  @abstr_code_section    * /= modifies the value to the operator's left by dividing it by the value to the operator's right:  @abstr_code_section     The thing to remember about these methods is that they modify the variable in place. So if we have two functions that depend on the same external variable, the order in which they're called matters. Follow along in console:  @abstr_code_section  Because these methods are more explicit, prefer+= to ++ and -= to -- (usually).  Okay, now we're ready to write solutions for the next two functions: inc(n) and dec(n).  "
365,4085,"Sometimes, we'll receive a number — well, we know it's a number, as we've seen many numbers in the past. JavaScript, however, won't know that it's a number because it shows up wrapped in quotes — JavaScript, then, thinks it's a string.  Luckily, JavaScript gives us tools to turn these strings into proper numbers (that is, numbers that JavaScript understands).  "
365,4086,"The first such tool is the function parseInt(), which accepts two arguments: the value to parse and the base of the value being parsed. _Usually_ you will want to work with base @abstr_number , so a typical call to parseInt() looks like  @abstr_code_section  What happens if we pass a representation of a non-integer to parseInt()? Let's try it:  @abstr_code_section  If we enter the above in console, we'll see that parseInt() forces the parsed number to be an integer — which makes sense when we think about it, right?  What happens, though, if we pass utter nonsense to parseInt()? Go ahead and try it in the console — something like  @abstr_code_section  What did it return? NaN? What is that?  NaN stands for ""not a number"" — pretty handy, right? This is the number (in the JavaScript sense) that JavaScript returns when it can't determine a valid value for a numeric operation.  "
365,4087,"Above, we saw that parseInt() lops off everything after the decimal point and only returns integers. If we want to preserve decimals, we'll need to use parseFloat().  Unlike parseInt(), parseFloat() accepts only a single argument, the thing to be parsed. We can use it like so:  @abstr_code_section  You're now ready to solve the final two tests in this lab, makeInt(n) and preserveDecimal(n).  "

366,4089,Brief usage:       takeown [-T] [-r] [-s] PATH     takeown [-T] -a USER PATH...     takeown [-T] -l PATH...     takeown [-T] -d USER PATH...   
366,4090,"takeown allows administrators to delegate taking ownersip ownership of files and directories to non-administrators. It uses the set-uid bit to gain the necessary privileges to do so.  Example: the administrator wants to let the user pablo take over ownership of files in /var/shared/Incoming. To that effect, the administrator runs:       takeown -a pablo /var/shared/Incoming   Once he has done so, the user pablo can run the command:       takeown /var/shared/Incoming/some-file.txt   and takeown will change the owner of the file some-file.txt to pablo.  Each delegation is recorded in a file .takeown.delegations stored in the root directory of the volume containing the delegated file / directory.  Delegations recorded on a volume only apply to files and directories stored in the volume. Delegations do not propagate across mount points. If a user has been granted a delegation on a directory, he will be authorized to take ownership of any files contained in that directory, so long as said files are in the same volume.  The flag -r in the takeown command induces takeown to grant ownership to the invoking user recursively across all files and subdirectories of the specified paths. The caveat about not crossing mount points applies -- if another volume is mounted within the path specified to a takeown -r command, that volume will be skipped silently.  For security reasons, attempts by an authorized user to take ownership of a volume or ownership of the delegation record file will be silently ignored.  "
366,4091,"To allow a user to take ownership of files under a directory, or specific files, run:       takeown username /path/to/directory/or/file...   This will delegate the taking of ownership to the user, allowing him to run takeown to take ownership of any file within the specified paths.  WARNING: if you delegate the taking of ownership of a volume to a user, that user may take ownership of the volume itself, and then remove the delegation store. This is not a security issue -- it does not grant the user any extra privileges -- but it does prevent future uses of takeown by unprivileged users in that volume.  "
366,4092,"To revoke an established delegation, use the following command:       takeown -d username /delegated/path   This removes the specific delegation established for that user name.  "
366,4093,"Any user may list established delegations with the command:       takeown -l [PATH]   However, only the administrator may list delegations for all users. Other users will only get to see the delegations assigned to him.  "
366,4094,"The action of taking ownership can be simulated with flag -s. In this mode, takeown will print what it would do rather than changing the file system.  "
366,4095,"If a file /.trace exists in the root directory, the user is allowed to specify the flag -T, which causes the program to print tracing information, useful to debug problems with the program.  "

367,4140,"Whenever your load test can't be conducted due to Vegeta hitting machine limits such as open files, memory, CPU or network bandwidth, it's a good idea to use Vegeta in a distributed manner.  In a hypothetical scenario where the desired attack rate is @abstr_number k requests per second, let's assume we have @abstr_number machines with vegeta installed.  Make sure open file descriptor and process limits are set to a high number for your user on each machine using the ulimit command.  We're ready to start the attack. All we need to do is to divide the intended rate by the number of machines, and use that number on each attack.

The examples provided use HTML @abstr_number doctype <!DOCTYPE html>.  Each section will be defined with an element containing the section class. The active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.  Sections should be placed inside a wrapper (<div id=""fullpage""> in this case). The wrapper can not be the body element. @abstr_code_section If you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first. @abstr_code_section  In order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the slide class: @abstr_code_section You can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the [demoPage.html` file](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/examples/demoPage.html).

This would be an example of a link with an anchor: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage/ @abstr_number (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section/slide manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in #secondPage/ @abstr_number.  Having the following initialization:  @abstr_code_section  The anchor at the end of the URL #secondPage/ @abstr_number defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondPage and the slide will be the @abstr_number nd slide, as we are using the index @abstr_number for it. (the fist slide of a section has index @abstr_number , as technically it is a section).  We could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute data-anchor on the HTML markup like so:  @abstr_code_section In this last case, the URL we would use would be #secondPage/slide @abstr_number, which is the equivalent to our previous #secondPage/ @abstr_number.  Note that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the data-anchor attribute, if no anchors array is provided.  Be careful! data-anchor tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).  "

It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport. This is ideal for footers. It is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, the plugin won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.  To create smaller sections just use the class fp-auto-height in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section/slide content.  @abstr_code_section  "
369,4160,A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class fp-auto-height-responsive. This way sections will be full height until the responsive mode gets fired.  
369,4161,Fullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site:    * active is added the current visible section and slide.   * active is added to the current menu element (if using the menu option).   * A class of the form fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE is added to the body element of the site. (eg: @abstr_hyperlink ) The SECTION and SLIDE parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide.   * fp-responsive is added to the body element when the entering in the responsive mode   * fp-enabled is added to the html element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed).   * fp-destroyed is added to the fullpage.js container when the plugin is destroyed.   * fp-enabled is added to the html element once the libary is initalized.    
369,4162,"@abstr_hyperlink fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer. When using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attribute to data-src as shown below:  @abstr_code_section  If you already use another lazy load solution which uses data-src as well, you can disable the fullPage.js lazy loading by setting the option lazyLoading: false.

The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. Be careful! anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE). Now anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute data-anchor as explained here.    * lockAnchors: (default false) Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the plugin. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.     Important It is helpful to understand that the values in the anchors option array correlate directly to the element with the class of .section by it's position in the markup.    * easing: (default easeInOutCubic) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling. It requires the file vendors/jquery.easings.min.js or @abstr_hyperlink for using some of @abstr_hyperlink . Other libraries could be used instead.    * easingcss @abstr_number: (default ease) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using css @abstr_number :true. You can use the @abstr_hyperlink (such as linear, ease-out...) or create your own ones using the cubic-bezier function. You might want to use @abstr_hyperlink for it.    * loopTop: (default false) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not.    * loopBottom: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not.    * loopHorizontal: (default true) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not.    * css @abstr_number: (default true). Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS @abstr_number transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS @abstr_number . If this option is set to true and the browser doesn't support CSS @abstr_number , a jQuery fallback will be used instead.    * autoScrolling: (default true) Defines whether to use the ""automatic"" scrolling or the ""normal"" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser/device window in tablets and mobile phones.    * fitToSection: (default true) Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to true the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section (when )    * fitToSectionDelay: (default @abstr_number ). If fitToSection is set to true, this delays the fitting by the configured milliseconds.    * scrollBar: (default false) Determines whether to use scrollbar for the site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the autoScrolling functionality will still work as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.    * paddingTop: (default @abstr_number) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: ' @abstr_number px', paddingTop: ' @abstr_number em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header.    * paddingBottom: (default @abstr_number) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: ' @abstr_number px', paddingBottom: ' @abstr_number em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer.    * fixedElements: (default null) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the css @abstr_number option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: fixedElements: '#element @abstr_number , .element @abstr_number ')    * normalScrollElements: (default null) If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: normalScrollElements: '#element @abstr_number , .element @abstr_number '). This option should not be applied to any section/slide element itself.    * normalScrollElementTouchThreshold : (default @abstr_number) Defines the threshold for the number of hops up the html node tree Fullpage will test to see if normalScrollElements is a match to allow scrolling functionality on divs on a touch device. (For example: normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: @abstr_number)    * bigSectionsDestination: (default null) Defines how to scroll to a section which size is bigger than the viewport. By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are top, bottom, null.    * keyboardScrolling: (default true) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard.    * touchSensitivity: (default @abstr_number) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section / slide    * continuousVertical: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section or should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one. Not compatible with loopTop, loopBottom or any scroll bar present in the site (scrollBar:true or autoScrolling:false).    * continuousHorizontal: (default false) @abstr_hyperlink . Defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not, and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not. Not compatible with loopHorizontal. Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    * scrollHorizontally: (default false) @abstr_hyperlink . Defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad. Ideal for story telling. Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *interlockedSlides: (defaultfalse) @abstr_hyperlink . Determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction. Possible values aretrue,falseor an array with the interlocked sections. For example[ @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number ]starting by @abstr_number . Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *dragAndMove: (defaultfalse) @abstr_hyperlink . Enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers. Possible values aretrue,false,fingersonly. Requires fullPage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *offsetSections: (defaultfalse) @abstr_hyperlink . Provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage. Ideal to show visitors there's more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section. Requires fullPage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number To define the percentage of each section the attributedata-percentagemust be used. The centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attributedata-centered(default totrueif not specified). For example: @abstr_code_section    *resetSliders: (defaultfalse). @abstr_hyperlink . Defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section. Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *fadingEffect: (defaultfalse). @abstr_hyperlink . Defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one. Possible values aretrue,false,sections,slides. It can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally, or to both at the time. Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *animateAnchor: (defaulttrue) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.    *recordHistory: (defaulttrue) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set totrueeach section/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set tofalse, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect ont he browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when usingautoScrolling:false.    *menu: (defaultfalse) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the classactive. This won't generate a menu but will just add theactiveclass to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links. In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML @abstr_number data-tag (data-menuanchor) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example: @abstr_code_section @abstr_code_section     **Note:** the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when usingcss @abstr_number :true. Otherwise it will be appended to thebodyby the plugin itself.    *navigation: (defaultfalse) If set totrue, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles.    *navigationPosition: (defaultnone) It can be set toleftorrightand defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one).    *navigationTooltips: (default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example:navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']. You can also define them by using the attributedata-tooltipin each section if you prefer.    *showActiveTooltip: (defaultfalse) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation.    *slidesNavigation: (defaultfalse) If set totrueit will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site.    *slidesNavPosition: (defaultbottom) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admitstopandbottomas values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color.    *scrollOverflow: (defaultfalse) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set totrue, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in theafterRendercallback. In case of setting it totrue, it requires the vendor library @abstr_hyperlink and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin. For example:  @abstr_code_section     In order to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the classfp-noscroll. For example:*scrollOverflowOptions: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of @abstr_hyperlink . You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check @abstr_hyperlink for more info.    *sectionSelector: (default.section) Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.    *slideSelector: (default.slide) Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin slides. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.    *responsiveWidth: (default@abstr_number) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A classfp-responsiveis added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to @abstr_number , whenever the browser's width is less than @abstr_number the plugin will scroll like a normal site.    *responsiveHeight: (default@abstr_number) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A classfp-responsiveis added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to @abstr_number , whenever the browser's height is less than @abstr_number the plugin will scroll like a normal site.    *responsiveSlides: (defaultfalse) @abstr_hyperlink . When set totrueslides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired. (by using theresponsiveWidthorresponsiveHeightoptions detailed above). Requires fullpage.js >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .    *lazyLoading: (defaulttrue) Lazy loading is active by default which means it will lazy load any media element containing the attributedata-src` as detailed in the @abstr_hyperlink . If you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage.js feature.      "

Source images can either be a png, psd __Photoshop__ or ai __Illustrator__ file. Images are generated using Ionic's image resizing and cropping server, instead of requiring special libraries and plugins to be installed locally.  Since each platform has different image requirements, it's best to make a source image for the largest size needed, and let the CLI do all the resizing, cropping and copying for you. Newly generated images will be placed in the resources directory at the root of the Cordova project. Additionally, the CLI will update and add the correct <platform> configs to the project's @abstr_hyperlink file.  During the build process, Cordova (v @abstr_number . @abstr_number or later) will look through the project's @abstr_hyperlink file and copy the newly created resource images to the platform's specific resource folder.

373,4288,"Modern large scale distributed application architectures, wherein components are distributed across the internet on multiple hosts and multiple CPU cores, are often based on a messaging or event bus that allows the various distributed components to communicate asynchronously with each other. Typically the messaging bus is some form of messaging queue service such as AMQP or ZeroMQ. The message bus supports what is commonly referred to as a publish/subscribe methodology for information exchange.  While there are many advantages to a full featured message queuing service, one of the disadvantagesis the inability to manage performance at scale.  A message queuing service performs two distinct but complementary functions.    * The first is asynchronous transport of messages over the internet.   * The second is message queue management, that is, the identification, tracking, storage, and distribution of messages between publishers and subscribers via queues.    One of the advantages of a message queuing service for many applications is that the service hides behind an API, the complexities of queue management from the clients. The disadvantage is that at scale, where the volume of messages, the timing of messages, and the associated demands on memory, network, and cpu capacity become critical, the client has little ability to tune the service for performance. Often MQ services become bottlenecks for the distributed application. The more complicated MQ services, like AMQP, tend to be unreliable under load.  Separating the function of network transport of asynchrounous event from the function of message queue management allows independant tuning at scale of each function.  Most if not all of the MQ services are based on TCP/IP for transport. TCP/IP adds significant latency to the network communications and is therefore not well suited for the asynchronous nature of distibuted event driven application communications. This is primarily due to the way TCP/IP handles connection setup and teardown as well as failed connections in order to support streams. Fundamentally TCP/IP is optomized for sending large contiguous data streams not many small aynchronous events or messages. While not a problem for small scale systems, the differences in the associated traffic characteristics can become problematic at scale.  Because UDP/IP has lower latency and is connectionless, it is much better suited to many small asynchronous messages and scales better. The drawback of bare UDP/IP is that it is not reliable. What is needed, therefore, is a tuned transport protocol that adds reliability to UDP/IP without sacrificing latency and scalability. A transactioned protocol, is much more appropriate for providing reliablity to asynchronous event transport than a streaming protocol.  Morover, because most MQ services are based on TCP/IP they tend to also use HTTP and therefore TLS/SSL for secure communications. While using HTTP provides easy integration with web based systems, it can become problematic for high performant systems Furthermore, TLS is also problematic as a security system both from performance and vulnerabilty aspects.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography, on the other hand, provides increases in security with lower performance requirements relative to over other approaches. LibSodium provides an open source Elliptic Curve Cryptographic library with support for both authentication and encryption. The CurveCP protocol is based on LibSodium and provides a handshake protocol for bootstrapping secure network exchanges of information.  Finally, one of the best ways to manage and fine tune processor resources (cpu, memory, network) in distributed concurrent event driven applications is to use something called micro-threads. A microthread is typically an in-language feature that allows logical concurrency with no more overhead than a function call. Micro threading uses cooperative multi-tasking instead of threads and/or processes and avoids many of the complexities of resource contention, context switching, and interprocess communications while providing much higher total performance.  Because all the cooperative micro-threads run in one process, a simple micro-threaded application is limited to one CPU core. To enable full utilization of all CPU cores, the application needs to be able to run at least one process per CPU core. This requires same host inter-process communications. But unlike the conventional approach to multi-processing where there is of one process per logical concurrent function, a micro-threaded multi-process application has instead one micro-thread per logical concurrent function and the total number of micro-threads is distributed amoungst a minimal number of processes, no more than the number of cpu cores. This optimizes the use of the cpu power while minimizes the overhead of process context switching.  An example of a framework that uses this type of micro-threaded but multi-process architecture is Erlang. Indeed, the success of the Erlang model provided support for the viability of the RAET approach. Indeed, one might ask, why not use Erlang? Unfortunately, the Erlang ecosystem is somewhat limited in comparison to Python's and the language itself uses what one might describe as a very unfortunate syntax. One of the design objectives behine RAET was to leverage existing Python expertise and the richness of the Python ecosystem but still be able to develop distributed applications using a micro-threaded multi-process architectural model. The goal was to combine the best of both worlds.  RAET is designed to provide secure reliable scalable asynchronous message/event transport over the internet in a micro-threaded multi-process application framework that uses UDP for interhost communication and LibSodium for authentication, encryption and the CurveCP handshake for secure bootstrap.  The queue management and micro-threaded application support is provided by Ioflo. RAET is a complementary project to Ioflo in that RAET enables multiple Ioflo applications to work together over a network as part of a distributed application.  The primary use case and motivating problem that resulted in the development of RAET was the need to enable SaltStack to scale better. SaltStack is a remote execution and configuration management platform written in Python. SaltStack uses ZeroMQ ( @abstr_number MQ) as its message bus or message queuing service. ZeroMQ is based on TCP/IP so suffers from the aforementioned latency and non-asynchronicity issues of TCP/IP based architectures. Moreover because ZeroMQ integrates queue management and transport in a monolithic way with special ""sockets"", tuning the performance of the queuing independent of the transport at scale becomes problematic. Tracing down bugs can also be problematic.  "

373,4292," The UDP channel is a “Road""   * The members of a Road are “Estates” (as in real estate lots that front the road)   * Each Estate has a unique UDP Host Port address “ha” , a unique string “name” and unique numerical ID “eid"".   * One Estate on the Road is the “Main” Estate   * The Main Estate is responsible for allowing other estates to join the Road via the Join (Key Exchange) and Allow (CurveCP) transactions   * The Main Estate is also responsible for routing messages between other Estates     "
373,4293," Within each Estate may be a “Lane”. This is a UXD channel.   * The members of a Lane are “Yards” (as in subdivision plots within the Estate)   * Each Yard on a Lane has a unique UXD file name host address “ha’, and a unique string “name”. There is also a numerical Yard ID “yid"" that the class uses to generate yard names but it is not an attribute of the Yard instance.   * The Lane name is also used with the Yard Name to form a unique Filename that is the ha of the UXD   * One Yard on a Lane is the “Main” Yard   * The Main Yard is responsible for forming the Lane and permitting other Yards to be on the lane. There is yet no formal process for this. Currently there is a flag that will drop packets from any Yard that is not already in the list of Yards maintained by the Main yard. Also file permissions can be used to prevent spurious Yards from communicating with the Main Yard.   * The Main Yard is responsible for routing messages between other yards on the Lane     "
373,4294," Each Estate UDP interface is run via a RoadStack (UDP sockets) which is run within the context of an IoFlo House (so think of the House that runs the UDP Stack as the Manor House of the Estate)   * Each Yard UXD interface is run via a LaneStack (Unix domain socket) which is run within the context of an IoFlo House (so think of Houses that run UXD stacks as accessory Houses (Tents, Shacks) on the Estate)   * The ""Manor"" House is special in that it runs both the UDP stack for the Estate and also runs the UXD Stack for the Main Yard   * The House that runs the Main Estate UDP Stack can be thought of as Mayor’s House   * Within the context of a House is a Data Store. Shares in the Store are Addressed by the unique Share Name which is a dotted path     "
373,4295,"Given the Ioflo execution architecture described above, routing is performed as follows:    * In order to address a specific Estate, the Estate Name is required   * In order to address a specific Yard within an Estate, the Yard Name is required   * In order to address a specific Queue within a House, the Share Name is required    The UDP stack maps Estate Name to UDP HA and Estate ID The UXD stack maps Yard Name to UXD HA The Store of any IoFlo behavior maps Share Name to Share reference  Therefore Routing from: a source identified by a queue in a source Share, in a source Yard, in a source Estate to: a destination identified by a queue, in a destination Share, in a destination Yard, in a destination Estate  requires two Triples, one for Source and one for Destination  Source (Estate Name, Yard Name, Share Name)  Destination (Estate Name, Yard Name, Share Name)  If any element of the Triple is None or Empty then a Default is used.

377,4374,"Novel mode is a minor mode which converts emacs into a screen reader, or in other words, it enables distraction free reading. It is however not suited for distraction free editing. Try writeroom mode if you're looking for this.  When turned on, it does the following conversions:    * disable almost all distractions, as menu, toolbar, scrollbar   * enlarge font size   * switch to variable width font   * enable word wrap (without fringe marker)   * increase line spacing   * add a window margin to the left and right (thereby centering the text)   * disable all input keys (rendering the buffer read-only)   * disable the cursor   * switch to buffer-scrolling (like e.g. in Acroread)   * display current reading position in percent   * add a couple of convenience one-key commands    Novel mode provides the following one-key commands, when active:       n           scroll one page down     p           scroll one page up           scroll one line down             scroll one line up     mousewheel  scroll linewise up or down     SPC         scroll one page down           increase margins, makes visible text narrower          decrease margins, makes visible text wider     +           increase font size     -           decrease font size     i           invert video display     q           quit novel mode     ?           display key mapping   Important: while normal key input (beside the ones listed above), is disabled, Control and Meta still work, of course. Please be also aware that this mode might conflict with god-mode or evil-mode.  If you use this mode quite often, then it might be a good idea to use save-place mode, so that a text file will be opened where you left last time (just like any ebook reader would do). Here's how to do that:       (if (version< emacs-version "" @abstr_number . @abstr_number "")         (progn           (require 'saveplace)           (setq-default save-place t))       (save-place-mode  @abstr_number ))   The name novel mode is not my idea, there's a function on Xah's ergomacs page with a function for this kind of stuff: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_novel_reading_mode.html. In fact, this mode is based on this function, I had it in my .emacs file and enhanced it all the time. At some point it made more sence to maintain this baby in its own mode - hence novel-mode.  "
377,4375,"To use, save novel-mode.el to a directory in your load-path.  Add something like this to your config:       (require 'novel-mode)     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'novel-mode)   or load it manually, when needed:       M-x novel-mode   "

379,4386,"This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the Google Phone Gallery , which no longer exists. Here is a historical reference: @abstr_hyperlink  Each tagged commit is a separate lesson teaching a single aspect of the framework.  The full tutorial can be found at https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.  "
379,4387, 
379,4388, A good place to learn about setting up git is @abstr_hyperlink .   * You can find documentation and download git @abstr_hyperlink .     
379,4389, Get @abstr_hyperlink .   * Install the tool dependencies: npm install   
379,4390, The application filesystem layout structure is based on the @abstr_hyperlink project.   * There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the application server by fetching static JSON files.   * Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing an Angular application.     
379,4391,You can check out any point of the tutorial using:  @abstr_code_section  To see the changes made between any two lessons use the git diff command:  @abstr_code_section  
379,4392, Add the 'angular.js' script.   * Add the ngApp directive to bootstrap the application.   * Add a simple template with an expression.     
379,4393, Add a stylesheet file ('app/app.css').   * Add a static list with two phones.     
379,4394, Convert the static phone list to dynamic by:     * Creating a PhoneListController controller.     * Extracting the data from HTML into the controller as an in-memory dataset.     * Converting the static document into a template with the use of the ngRepeat directive.   * Add a simple unit test for the PhoneListController controller to show how to write tests and run them using Karma.     
379,4395," Introduce components.   * Combine the controller and the template into a reusable, isolated phoneList component.   * Refactor the application and tests to use the phoneList component.     "
379,4396," Refactor the layout of files and directories, applying best practices and techniques that will make the application easier to maintain and expand in the future:     * Put each entity in its own file.     * Organize code by feature area (instead of by function).     * Split code into modules that other modules can depend on.     * Use external templates in .html files (instead of inline HTML strings).     "
379,4397, Add a search box to demonstrate:     * How the data-binding works on input fields.     * How to use the filter filter.     * How ngRepeat automatically shrinks and grows the number of phones in the view.   * Add an end-to-end test to:     * Show how end-to-end tests are written and used.     * Prove that the search box and the repeater are correctly wired together.     
379,4398, Add an age property to the phone model.   * Add a drop-down menu to control the phone list order.   * Override the default order value in controller.   * Add unit and end-to-end tests for this feature.     
379,4399, Replace the in-memory dataset with data loaded from the server (in the form of a static 'phone.json' file to keep the tutorial backend agnostic):     * The JSON data is loaded using the $http service.   * Demonstrate the use of services and dependency injection (DI):     * $http is injected into the controller through DI.     * Introduce DI annotation methods: .$inject and inline array     
379,4400, Add a phone image and links to phone pages.   * Add an end-to-end test that verifies the phone links.   * Tweak the CSS to style the page just a notch.     
379,4401," Introduce the $route service, which allows binding URLs to views for routing and deep-linking:     * Add the ngRoute module as a dependency.     * Configure routes for the application.     * Use the ngView directive in 'index.html'.   * Create a phone list route (/phones):     * Map /phones to the existing phoneList component.   * Create a phone detail route (/phones/:phoneId):     * Map /phones/:phoneId to a new phoneDetail component.     * Create a dummy phoneDetail component, which displays the selected phone ID.     * Pass the phoneId parameter to the component's controller via $routeParams.     "
379,4402," Implement fetching data for the selected phone and rendering to the view:     * Use $http in PhoneDetailController to fetch the phone details from a JSON file.     * Create the template for the detail view.   * Add CSS styles to make the phone detail page look ""pretty-ish"".     "
379,4403, Implement a custom checkmark filter.   * Update the phoneDetail template to use the checkmark filter.   * Add a unit test for the checkmark filter.     
379,4404, Make the thumbnail images in the phone detail view clickable:     * Introduce a mainImageUrl property on PhoneDetailController.     * Implement the setImage() method for changing the main image.     * Use ngClick on the thumbnails to register a handler that changes the main image.     * Add an end-to-end test for this feature.     
379,4405, Replace $http with $resource.   * Create a custom Phone service that represents the RESTful client.   * Use a custom Jasmine equality tester in unit tests to ignore irrelevant properties.     
379,4406," Add animations to the application:     * Animate changes to the phone list, adding, removing and reordering phones with ngRepeat.     * Animate view transitions with ngView.     * Animate changes to the main phone image in the phone detail view.   * Showcase three different kinds of animations:     * CSS transition animations.     * CSS keyframe animations.     * JavaScript-based animations.     "
379,4407,The following docs describe how you can test and develop this application further.  
379,4408,"The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink . You can install these by running:  @abstr_code_section  This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the tutorial.  Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run it whenever you like.  "
379,4409, Run npm start.   * Navigate your browser to @abstr_hyperlink to see the application   * running.     
379,4410,"We recommend using @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink for your unit tests/specs, but you are free to use whatever works for you.    * Start Karma with npm test.   * A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers, others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the karma.conf.js file.   * Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just change any of your these files.    "
379,4411,"We recommend using @abstr_hyperlink for end-to-end (e @abstr_number e) testing.  It requires a webserver that serves the application. See the _Running the Application during Development_ section, above.    * Serve the application with: npm start   * In a separate terminal/command line window run the e @abstr_number e tests: npm run protractor.   * Protractor will execute the e @abstr_number e test scripts against the web application itself. The project is set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against other browsers, you must modify the configuration at e @abstr_number e-tests/protractor-conf.js.    "

381,4420,"FormBuilder is a library that can be used to create forms online. These forms will be able to accept user input and save the data in varying ways depending on what data-types have been chosen for the input fields.  There are many different input field data-types and each have different filters, validation methods, and options that dictate what kind of data they can or can not accept, and how the input fields will look and behave. These types have been developed to meet the typical needs of what would be desired from an online form, such as a phone number type, an email type, a regular text input type, and many more. If you would like to see a full list of the input types that are available to you with formBuilder please feel free to look ahead to the Data Types section in the User Guide.  It is also possible, if these types do not meet the requirements of what is needed for a form that is being built, to easily design a custom input type by modifying a set of base methods, or developing a regular expression to define what input will be allowed in the new type. A more detailed description of how to do this can be found in the Customization section of the User Guide.  If you would like to see an example of a form that is built using formBuilder, and how the data from that form is saved, feel free to look ahead to our Live Demo.  "
381,4421,"FormBuilder is used by creating forms and then initializing them as formBuilder widgets. FormBuilder will construct the form fields automatically. You can then build upon those forms by adding as many different kinds of input as are desired.  If you would like to know how to use formBuilder and see examples of each different input types and how they work, please feel free to look ahead to the User Guide.  For a more in-depth understanding of how to use and manipulate each different available resource in the formBuilder library, please feel free to look ahead to our API Reference  "
381,4422,"FormBuilder allows you to create complicated input fields on forms by using only one or two lines of code in your html file. By implementing one or two attributes on an input field you will be able to apply large changes to how the field will appear and how it will handle data.  It is also a quick and easy way to be able to eliminate most human error from any online form that you are trying to build. By using input types that have been designed to only accept certain entries you can help to prevent the chance that forms will be submitted to you incorrectly.  FormBuilder is also very easy to understand and implement into your code. The user guide and API reference that have been provided to you are useful tools to be able to understand and see examples of how to build your form using formBuilder. In short, formBuilder is a useful tool that can be used to enhance any online form that you are trying to build.  "

Here's how you use you-get to download a video from @abstr_hyperlink :  @abstr_code_section  And here's why you might want to use it:    * You enjoyed something on the Internet, and just want to download them for your own pleasure.   * You watch your favorite videos online from your computer, but you are prohibited from saving them. You feel that you have no control over your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.)   * You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your computer.   * You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.    What you-get can do for you:    * Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and a bunch more. (See the full list of supported sites)   * Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more ads.   * Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page.   * Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.    Interested? Install it now and get started by examples.  Are you a Python programmer? Then check out @abstr_hyperlink and fork it!  @abstr_image  "

388,4493,"Submission by Michael Raimi (raimi.michael@gmail.com)   I decided to represent the graph as an adjacency list keyed by username which I assumed to be unique. This assumption was supported by the numerical suffixes on names such as 'Caroline-Kaiser- @abstr_number '. The value of the adjacency list is a tuple of the node's degree count and a set of neighbors the node shares an edge with. It's a set to prevent any bookkeeping issues in the event of records with the same target/actor pair.  The @abstr_number second window is represented by a list (used essentially as a queue) of tuples of target, actor, datetime records. It is always in order by timestamp and has linear insertion on out of order nodes but is O( @abstr_number ) otherwise.  NOTE: In the event that multiple records in the same @abstr_number second window have the same target/actor pair multiple records in the window are created with unique datetimes but no new edges are created, and as a result no degree counts are modified. This has the same effect as updating the edge's timestamp.  Below are other data structures and counts used to support graph operations and modifications:    * There is a dictionary keeping track of how many instances of a certain degree exist in the graph e.g. there are @abstr_number nodes with degree @abstr_number .    * There is a list of integers that represents the current degree values in the graph e.g. there are nodes of degree @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , and so on. It's always sorted.    * There is a total node count used for sanity checking and to lookup the median    * There is a dictionary keeping count of how many times a unique target/actor pair is received. The size of this data structure is linear in the number of edges and vertices of the graph multiplied by some factor d, which represents the highest number of records made by a single target/actor pair. In Big-O it would be O(d(V + E)). This implementation would be prohibitive in the case where a few power users make tons of transactions. An alternative implementation to this would be to remove the old record from the window and insert the new one in the correct position. This would have linear processing cost in the size of records in the window but could reduce the memory footprint by a constant factor. This implementation would be somewhat prohibitive in the case of a window with many records all fitting within the @abstr_number second constraint as an insertion     "
388,4494,"If we imagine all the possible degree values in a sorted list we could use the size of the list to find the value(s) in the middle representing the median degree. This code uses a similar approach by using the total node count, sorted degree keys, and the degree count dictionary to find the median. In short we iterate through the keys, using each one to key into the dictionary to find the degree where the median lies. It runs in time linear in the size of the degree key list which in the big dataset of @abstr_number was of size < @abstr_number .  Thanks for taking the time to consider me for the fellowship! "

389,4496,Compass是搜狗商业平台研发部开发的一套轻量级的分布式数据库访问框架，支持单库、主从库读写分离、分库、分库之后再分表、从库负载均衡和HA等使用场景，并且在框架层面提供了主从反延迟策略。Compass采用Spring配置的方式与应用系统整合，并能与目前主流的数据访问层框架Spring JdbcTemplate、MyBatis和Hibernate无缝集成，为应用系统提供透明的分布式数据访问服务。下图是Compass的功能点列表：  @abstr_image  
389,4497,Compass分为 @abstr_number 个子模块： * compass-core： Compass框架最核心的功能模块，提供指定路由键(RouteKey)的情况下的分布式数据库访问。 * compass-delayfree：提供主从反延迟的策略的集成，如果不使用该功能可以不依赖。 * compass-aggregation：提供有限程度的全库扫描、多库聚合和排序支持，如果不使用聚合功能可以不依赖。 * compass-sample:提供配置和代码编写范例。  
389,4498,Compass整体架构图如下所示：  @abstr_image  
389,4499,数据源切换预处理器提供了与Spring AOP的集成，通过拦截器的方式收集数据源切换所需的信息并保存到对象RouteContext之中，RouteContext包括分库路由键，主从库读写策略(决定本次访问应该读取主库还是从库)、service方法名、主从库反延时键。RouteContext会保存到当前线程的threadlocal之中，供下层组件使用，并且会在业务调用全部结束之后对当前线程的threadLocal之中的RouteContext进行清理。每个数据源需要配置单独的数据源切换预处理器，同时数据源切换预处理器需要配置在Spring的数据库事务拦截器之前。  
389,4500,在指定多个路由键以及不指定路由键的情况下提供有限程度的全库扫描、多库聚合和排序支持。  
389,4501,对JDBC规范的DataSource、Connection、Statement等接口进行代理，分为单库数据源SingleDataSource、主从数据源MasterSlaveDataSource和分库数据源ShardDataSource这 @abstr_number 种数据源，其中MasterSlaveDataSource包含一个或多个SingleDataSource，ShardDataSource包含一个或多个MasterSlaveDataSource，MasterSlaveDataSource根据数据源切换预处理器设置的信息实现主从库选择、故障探测和HA等功能。ShardDataSource则根据据数据源切换预处理器设置的信息实现分库和分表路由、Sql解析和表名替换等功能。  
389,4502,"Compass框架工作流程如下图所示：  @abstr_image  @abstr_number . 上层应用(比如Action层)对Service层的调用会被数据源切换预处理器所拦截，数据源切换预处理器收集分库路由键，主从库读写策略(决定本次访问应该读取主库还是从库)、Service方法名、主从库反延时键保存在threadLocal里面的RouteContext对象中，供后续步骤使用。  @abstr_number . Service层调用Dao层的方法执行数据库操作的时候，会通过Spring JdbcTemplate、MyBatis和Hibernate等数据访问层框架访问到分库数据源ShardDataSource。  @abstr_number . ShardDataSource根据保存在threadLocal中的RouteContext里面的分区路由键和用户配置的路由策略进行路由，定位出当前的操作应该路由到哪个主从数据源MasterSlaveDataSource的哪个分表上，路由结果的唯一标识在代码中用TableContext表示。注意如果是在分库之后再进一步进行了分表的话，需要同时对这次操作涉及的SQL语句进行解析，根据路由结果标识TableContext将SQL语句中的逻辑表名替换为实际的物理分表的表名，拿用户账号表acount举例，如果用户输入的SQL语句为select * from account，并且路由结果为这个SQL语句应该路由到 @abstr_number 号库的第 @abstr_number 张分表，那么改写之后的SQL语句就形如select * from account_ @abstr_number _ @abstr_number 。  @abstr_number . ShardDataSource路由到某个MasterSlaveDataSource之后,MasterSlaveDataSource会进一步根据保存在threadLocal中的RouteContext里面的用户配置的主从库读写策略和主从库反延时策略来进行主从选择。如果选择读取从库，那么需要进一步根据用户配置的负载均衡策略在多个从库之间进行负载均衡，同时如果有从库出现故障还需要及时探测到并进行HA，MasterSlaveDataSource最终会选择出一个单库数据源SingleDataSource来进行操作。  @abstr_number . SingleDataSource只是对实际的连接池数据源(比如DBCP、C @abstr_number P @abstr_number 等)的简单封装，SingleDataSource会将操作都委托给连接池数据源进行实际的数据库访问。  "
389,4503,对于分库分表的时候需要对SQL语句中的数据表名进行修改的情况，Compass采用开源项目 @abstr_hyperlink 进行SQL解析并进行表名修改，目前采用的JSqlParser版本是 @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number 。  
389,4504,Compass支持JDK @abstr_number . @abstr_number 以及以上的版本。

396,4594,"Note that these instructions assume the non-VDI image, running on QEMU. For Windows users, download the VDI image and use VirtualBox. After the Virtual Machine is running, the instructions are identical.  There is an example @abstr_hyperlink already setup. The username and password to this VM are both ecoop- @abstr_number. To run the VM, with QEMU, do the following:       qemu-system-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number  -enable-kvm -m  @abstr_number  -drive file=ecoop- @abstr_number .qcow @abstr_number ,format=qcow @abstr_number   The login information you'll always want to use is:       Username: ecoop- @abstr_number     Password: ecoop- @abstr_number   This VM should have all the requirements needed to run all of the experiments. If you want to SSH into the VM from your host, use the following:       qemu-system-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number  -enable-kvm -m  @abstr_number  -drive file=ecoop- @abstr_number .qcow @abstr_number ,format=qcow @abstr_number  -net user,hostfwd=tcp:: @abstr_number -: @abstr_number  -net nic   Then from your host machine do:       ssh ecoop- @abstr_number @localhost -p @abstr_number   Note that the VM needs to be connected to the internet in order for some packages to build.  "
396,4595,"If you are using the VM image that we've distributed, the clang++ executable on that VM points to a prebuilt version of our tool. However, we've included the sources and you can build your own clang++ from scratch as follows.  Ensure you have the base-devel group installed and the multilib repository enabled. Afterwards you can build the package in the standard Arch Linux fashion:       cd ~/abs     makepkg -s   After building the tool, you can use our set of @abstr_number small test cases you run to ensure the tool works correctly. Navigate to the test directory to see these tests:       cd ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /projects/compiler-rt/test/csan   Note: if you haven't built the tool, this directory will not exist, do the following first:       cd ~/abs     makepkg -o   The expected test results are embedded within the source files themselves. Any lines with CHECK are expected to occur on stderr when the source file is compiled and run with our tool enabled. Any lines beginning with CHECK-NOT should not occur when our tool is used. To run all the tests do the following:       cd ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /build     make check-csan   Note @abstr_number : you must have built the tool in order to run make check-csan!  Note @abstr_number : for the timing results in the paper, ran a debug version of the tool. To build a debug version, follow these steps:       cd ~/abs     makepkg -s -p PKGBUILD-debug   Then replace the current version of our packages with these debugging ones with:       pacman -U *.pkg.tar.xz   "
396,4596,"Instead of automatically running the tests with make check-csan (and not getting much feedback, due to the LLVM testing framework), you can also manually run the tests. You do need to cd ~/abs; makepkg -o as described above, though.  To manually run them yourself do the following:       cd ~     clang++ -fsanitize=const -g ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /projects/compiler-rt/test/csan/const-object.cc -o const-object     ./const-object   You may explore all the other tests by exploring ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /projects/compiler-rt/test/csan and running them in a similar manner.  "
396,4597,"To use the tool, use clang++ as you normally would, but add the flags -fsanitize=const -g. You should get more precise results if you disable optimizations and include the frame pointer with -O @abstr_number -fno-omit-frame-pointer. To run the example given in Listing @abstr_number of the paper, do the following:       cd ~/examples     clang++ -std=c++ @abstr_number  -fsanitize=const -g listing- @abstr_number .cpp   You can run the resulting executable as ./a.out and you should see a warning. To write to an external log file, use the log_path option. For example, to log the results to a file called listing- @abstr_number .log do the following:       CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=listing- @abstr_number .log ./a.out   After running the program again, there should be no extra output on stderr and there should be a listing- @abstr_number .log.XXXXX file in the current directory where XXXXX are random numbers. Feel free to try it out!  "
396,4598,"Note that to browse the implementation you have to have the sources extracted. To extract the sources, do the following:       cd ~/abs     makepkg -o   The first part of the implementation is getting Clang to annotate definition expressions of declaration statements so that ConstSanitizer can ignore them. The code implementing this is in: ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDebugInfo.cpp and ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDebugInfo.h. The part of the code generation we instrument is in ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDecl.cpp within the EmitAutoVarDecl method.  The heart of our implementation is located at: ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/ConstSanitizer.cpp. This file corresponds to the instrumentation of LLVM bit code that implements our runtime const tracking. The computation of the shadow values is in the getShadowVal method.  The runtime library is located at: ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /projects/compiler-rt/lib/csan/csan.cc. This file contains the implementation that reports the stack traces at runtime.  The modification to get Clang to recongize our new sanitizer option is located at: ~/abs/src/llvm-csan- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number /tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp.  "
396,4599,"All experiments are located in the experiments directory. To instrument a project, for example Ninja, do the following:       cd ~/experiments     python build.py ninja   The build script stores any build-time violations (for instance, that occur while running a project's tests as part of the build) in the experiments directory, in a file named PACKAGE-build.log. Ninja is an example of a project that runs tests as part of its build.  To create groupings for manual inspection, run python group.py ninja. The group.py script collects all results from log files with the specified project name.  The next subsections give examples of how we obtained the results in the paper.  "
396,4600,"Similar to the Ninja example above, tests are run as part of the build process. So you may do the following:       cd ~/experiments     python build.py protobuf     python group.py protobuf-build   These results should be comparable to ~/results/protobuf.txt after organization. Note that running the tests produces many protobuf-build.log.XXXXX files. While the group.py script does combine all build log files, the resulting file still contains a separate section for each build log file. We manually combined these sections and report combined results from all build logs.  Note that before manual post-processing we found @abstr_number unique warnings with @abstr_number occurences. There was one archetype, relating to message targets, we could not determine and did not include in the paper. This archetype had @abstr_number unique warnings with @abstr_number occurences and were manually identified. We also had a false positive due to incorrect debugging information (we believe). This archetype had @abstr_number unique locations with @abstr_number occurences. Manually removing these results should exactly match the results in the paper.  "
396,4601,"Similar to above, tests are run as part of the build process.  "
396,4602,"We obtained the Fish results by running the shell, following these steps:       cd ~/experiments     python build.py fish     CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=fish.log fish/pkg/fish/usr/bin/fish   Then press control-D to exit. Afterwards you can do the same as with Ninja:       python group.py fish   These results should correspond to the paper.  "
396,4603,"  cd ~/experiments     python build.py mosh     CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=mosh.log mosh/pkg/mosh/usr/bin/mosh --client=/home/ecoop- @abstr_number /experiments/mosh/pkg/mosh/usr/bin/mosh-client --server=/home/ecoop- @abstr_number /experiments/mosh/pkg/mosh/usr/bin/mosh-server localhost   Answer yes to the certificate (if prompted) and login using the same information used for the virtual machine (username `ecoop- @abstr_number`, password `ecoop- @abstr_number`).  Again, similar to the last case, use the group script:       python group.py mosh   These results should correspond to the paper (there may be more unique locations than in the paper).  "
396,4604,"Similar to Ninja, LLVM compiles llvm-tblgen and executes it as part of its build process. Therefore after running the build script the results should be accessible with:       cd ~/experiments     python group.py llvm-build   "
396,4605,"Similar to Fish, we run the executable. You may need to also include LD_LIBRARY_PATH like so:       cd ~/experiments     python build.py tesseract     CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=tesseract.log LD_LIBRARY_PATH=tesseract/pkg/tesseract/usr/lib tesseract/pkg/tesseract/usr/bin/tesseract stdin stdout   You should get an error along the lines of ""error opening data file"", and tesseract immediately exits. However, there will be some results, as before run:       python group.py tesseract   "
396,4606,"In this case, as part of the build process, the tests are run. Therefore the ninja-build.log.XXXXX shows what violations occur as part of the test suite. If you open this file and observe it, the first non-standard library portion of the stack trace should be in src/disk_interface_test.cc: @abstr_number : @abstr_number matching the results of the paper. There should be @abstr_number unique source locations, starting in the standard library, for all violations. To find these unique source locations, like for all other experiments, use the group script:       cd ~/experiments     python group.py ninja-build   This will group the raw results into unique locations and also give the dynamic violation count.  "
396,4607,"First build Wayland and install the package:       cd ~/experiments     python build.py wayland     sudo pacman -U wayland/wayland- @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number - @abstr_number -x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .pkg.tar.xz   Then you can build weston:       python build.py weston   Again, run the produced executable:       CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=weston.log weston/pkg/weston/usr/bin/weston   "
396,4608,"To collect the timing results, for example for Protobuf, do the following:       cd ~/experiments     python time.py protobuf   Note that you'll have to clear all the build files between each run. Do that with the following command (you need to cd into the project directory first).       cd ~/experiments/protobuf     rm -rf src pkg *.pkg.tar.xz   The resulting files will be in /tmp/time-protobuf-build and /tmp/time-protobuf-check. The last @abstr_number lines of the first file indicate how long it took to build with the tool enabled. The last @abstr_number lines of the second file indicate how long it took to run the tests with the tool enabled. After recording these numbers you can do the same procedure with the tool disabled. To collect the timing (after cleaning) results do:       cd ~/experiments     python time-disable-csan.py protobuf   "
396,4609,"Our results are in the results directory, organized by project name. These files represent our findings organized by manually categorizing the violations and putting them all under the same heading. The remaining results show the number of violations at each source location. These violations are annotated with source locations. "

398,4619,"For example, to add @abstr_hyperlink library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:       yarn add --exact leaflet   To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from @abstr_hyperlink repository in development, you would run following command:       yarn add --dev --exact @types/leaflet   Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that @abstr_hyperlink knows about them:  Edit src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts file: ~~~ import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js'; ~~~  Edit src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css file: ~~~ @import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css'; ~~~  Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.  For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at @abstr_hyperlink .  "
398,4620,"You can also use @abstr_hyperlink to generate some custom client code.

401,4639,"@abstr_hyperlink  Just as there was _Retroweaver_ et al. for running Java @abstr_number code with generics on Java @abstr_number . @abstr_number , _Retrolambda_ lets you run Java @abstr_number code with lambda expressions , method references and try-with-resources statements on Java @abstr_number , @abstr_number or @abstr_number . It does this by transforming your Java @abstr_number compiled bytecode so that it can run on an older Java runtime. After the transformation they are just a bunch of normal .class files, without any additional runtime dependencies. Read more details.  There is also limited support for backporting default methods and static methods on interfaces. This feature is disabled by default.  Retrolambda supports backporting to Java @abstr_number , Java @abstr_number and Java @abstr_number runtimes. And for adventurous developers there are @abstr_hyperlink that may let you go from Java @abstr_number down to Java @abstr_number . @abstr_number .  Android developers may use Retrolambda to take advantage of the Java @abstr_number features on Android. Serge Zaitsev has written @abstr_hyperlink and there is a Gradle plugin which makes it easy.  Retrolambda does not backport the new Java @abstr_number APIs, but there are other projects that have backported some of them:    * @abstr_hyperlink backports the java.util.stream API   * @abstr_hyperlink backports the java.time API    "
401,4640,"Retrolambda can be run as a Maven plugin, Gradle plugin or command line application. Also have a look at some tips for using Retrolambda effectively.  "
401,4641,"To run Retrolambda using Maven, add the following to your pom.xml:  @abstr_code_section  See the @abstr_hyperlink for all possible parameters. There is also a usage example in @abstr_hyperlink  "

Run java -jar retrolambda.jar without any additional options to see the instructions (for your convenience they are also shown below).  Your class files should now run on Java @abstr_number or older.  @abstr_code_section  "
401,4644,"Be sure to run comprehensive tests on your target JVM version (e.g. Java @abstr_number ), in case the code accidentally uses Java @abstr_number APIs or language features that Retrolambda doesn't backport.  During development, inside an IDE, it's the easiest to use Java @abstr_number , without Retrolamba, to compile and run tests. But in your continuous integration and release builds you should run all tests using the target Java version. For example, you can configure Maven Surefire Plugin to run tests @abstr_hyperlink .  I recommend setting up environment variables JAVA @abstr_number _HOME, JAVA @abstr_number _HOME etc. and referring to those variables in the build configuration, instead of relying on what happens to be the default Java version in JAVA_HOME.  You will need Java @abstr_number for compiling and also for generating Javadocs. JDK @abstr_number 's Javadoc tool will fail for some valid Java @abstr_number code.  "
401,4645,"Lambda expressions are backported by converting them to anonymous inner classes. This includes the optimization of using a singleton instance for stateless lambda expressions to avoid repeated object allocation.  Method references are basically just syntax sugar for lambda expressions and they are backported in the same way.  Try-with-resources statements are backported by removing calls to Throwable.addSuppressed if the target bytecode version is below Java @abstr_number . If you would like the suppressed exceptions to be logged instead of swallowed, please create a feature request and we'll make it configurable.  _Optionally also:_  Default methods are backported by copying the default methods to a companion class (interface name + ""$"") as static methods, replacing the default methods in the interface with abstract methods, and by adding the necessary method implementations to all classes which implement that interface.  Static methods on interfaces are backported by moving the static methods to a companion class (interface name + ""$""), and by changing all methods calls to call the new method location.[ @abstr_number ]  [ @abstr_number ] _The static methods are moved to a companion class even with default method support disabled, because some of them may be lambda implementation methods, but the method calls to static methods are not updated. This may cause weird error messages if static methods on interfaces are accidentally used without enabling default method support._  "
401,4646,"Does not backport Java @abstr_number APIs.  Backporting default methods and static methods on interfaces requires all backported interfaces and all classes which implement them or call their static methods to be backported together, with one execution of Retrolambda. In other words, you must _always do a clean build_. Also, backporting default methods won't work across module or dependency boundaries.  May break if a future JDK @abstr_number build stops generating a new class for each invokedynamic call. Retrolambda works so that it captures the bytecode that java.lang.invoke.LambdaMetafactory generates dynamically, so optimizations to that mechanism may break Retrolambda.  "

409,4728,"As with any programming language, there is a good chance that when editing a salt state, you have made a mistake.  In order to detect these mistakes, the salt engine needs to read your state, and apply it with the grains and pillars appropriate for the minion you are targeting.  Salt makes it very easy to test with an active master (or similar situations such as a masterless setup, or salt-ssh) by putting the state on the master (or similar) and calling the test_state, e.g.:  @abstr_code_section  This will display the state when it renders. However, the cost of this is longer than what's ideal.  In order to provide a slightly faster unit testing cycle, as well as a pre-commit hook that can be used to prevent unintended errors from getting into git, this script can do much of the same compilation as a salt master and the state.show_sls state (this uses the show_sls state).  "
409,4729,"The primary differences are as follows:  @abstr_number . All configuration is contained within the script and its configuration. @abstr_number . Grain data is not discovered from minions, it's provided in configuration. @abstr_number . Pillar data is provided as a json file rather than data collected by the saltmaster.  For each state that is being tested, a pseudo-run is initiated. It gathers its data from the grain configuration, pillar configuration, and internal values (most of which are default values internal to salt).  Once that data is obtained, the pseudo-run is executed and the state.show_sls function is used to return the data structure that is the result of the state being rendered.  To test a hypothesis, it's important to have an hypothesis in the first place. The results of the pseudo-run are compared with the desired results. Any differences present in the relevent keys cause the run in general to fail (this is to support acting as a git hook, so that a broken state isn't committed).  When the test script is invoked without any flags, only keys that exist in the desired result are compared to the actual result. This makes it easy to get started, because you can start with no expectations and add expecetations as you go along.  However, the ""-t"" flag can be passed to the script in order to ""test all""  "

The raw KDevelop comes with extremely useful cross-reference and code parsing tools, but they do not apply well to the Linux kernel. Problems are:    * The kernel source is huge, and parsing all the source code of all drivers is long and unpractical.   * Some implicitly declared macros (like __KERNEL__) are needed for the code to be parsed correctly. Without them lots of functions and data structures will appear as undeclared.   * A lot of the code (power management, SMP, etc) is conditionally compiled depending on the kernel configuration which is translated into more C defines. These defines are not seen by KDevelop and a huge part of relevant code is thus not parsed.   * All the same, architecture-dependant code cannot be parsed without a proper configuration    "

Data is not normally distributed, so statistical methods we applied to microarray data don't work here.  @abstr_number .

420,4799,"When we implemented modelV @abstr_number , we were thinking about ways that people buy things inside apps. We figured out many ways you can let your users purchase stuff in your game and we designed the new modelV @abstr_number to support @abstr_number of them: PurchaseWithMarket and PurchaseWithVirtualItem.  PurchaseWithMarket is a PurchaseType that allows users to purchase a VirtualItem with Google Play or the App Store. PurchaseWithVirtualItem is a PurchaseType that lets your users purchase a VirtualItem with a different VirtualItem. For Example: Buying @abstr_number Sword with @abstr_number Gems.  In order to define the way your various virtual items (Goods, Coins ...) are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of IStoreAsset (the same one from step @abstr_number in the ""Getting Started"" above).  Here is an example:  Lets say you have a _VirtualCurrencyPack_ you call TEN_COINS_PACK and a _VirtualCurrency_ you call COIN_CURRENCY:  @abstr_code_section  Now you can use _StoreInventory_ to buy your new VirtualCurrencyPack:  @abstr_code_section  And that's it! unity @abstr_number d-store knows how to contact Google Play or the App Store for you and will redirect your users to their purchasing system to complete the transaction. Don't forget to subscribe to store events in order to get the notified of successful or failed purchases (see @abstr_hyperlink ).  "
420,4800,"When you initialize _SoomlaStore_, it automatically initializes two other classes: _StoreInventory_ and _StoreInfo_: * _StoreInventory_ is a convenience class to let you perform operations on VirtualCurrencies and VirtualGoods. Use it to fetch/change the balances of VirtualItems in your game (using their ItemIds!) * _StoreInfo_ is where all meta data information about your specific game can be retrieved. It is initialized with your implementation of IStoreAssets and you can use it to retrieve information about your specific game.  The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA is preparing a cloud-based storage service that will allow this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you'll define.  Example Usages    * Get VirtualCurrency with itemId ""currency_coin"":  @abstr_code_section    * Give the user @abstr_number pieces of a virtual currency with itemId ""currency_coin"":  @abstr_code_section    * Take @abstr_number virtual goods with itemId ""green_hat"":  @abstr_code_section    * Get the current balance of green hats (virtual goods with itemId ""green_hat""):  @abstr_code_section     "

You should also include a reference to either the location of the steward's certificate file (steward.crtPath) or the actual certificate itself (steward.crtData).  If your steward is registered with a TAAS cloud, then you should also deifne the cloud.service domain and the location of TAAS certificate (cloud.crtPath) or the actual certificate itself (cloud.CrtData).  The state machine is fairly simple:    * There are two channels: 'console' and 'management'.    * Each of these channels will emit an 'open' event, letting you know whether login is required.    * When a channel is ready for use, it will emit a 'ready' event      * In the case of the 'console' channel, the 'data' parameter is an array indicating what privileges are authorized.      * In the case of the 'management' channel, the 'data' parameter is a user object.    * If either channel detects a remote close or an error, then these events are emitted, respectively.     The API does not attempt to recover on either a close, or error. Instead, you may choose to start over or exit, as you see fit.       var steward = new ClientAPI.ClientAPI(     { steward : { name    : 'steward.local'                 , crtPath : 'server.crt'                 }      , cloud   : { service : 'taas.thethingsystem.net'                 , crtPath : 'cloud.crt'                 }     }).on('open', function(channel, loginP) {       // check to see if login required       if (!loginP) {         if (channel === 'management') console.log('steward in developer mode, no need to log in.');         return;       }        steward.login('mrose/ @abstr_number ', ' @abstr_number ', function(err, error) {         if (!!err) return console.log('>>> login error: ' + JSON.stringify(error));          // logged in!       });     }).on('ready', function(channel, data) {       // when the management channel is ready, it's time to get to work!       if (channel !== 'management') return;        // ok, let's get to work!     }).on('close', function(channel) {       // typically, just log and recover/exit     }).on('error', function(err, channel) {       // typically, just log and recover/exit     });   "

Each method takes a callback which may be invoked more than once. Blocking operations in the steward typically result in two callbacks, the first is a success or failure indicator; and, if success is indicated, then a subsequent callback is made. The 'list _' and 'perform_ ' operations are not blocking, hence the callback is made exactly once.       // if (!doneP), then only a success/failure indication is present, and a subsequent invocation will occur!     var cb = function(message, doneP) { ... };      // invoked exactly once     var cb @abstr_number  = function(message) { ... };       steward.createActivity(name, uuid, event, task, armed, comments, cb);      steward.createDevice(name, uuid, whatami, info, comments, cb);      steward.createEvent(name, uuid, actor, observe, parameter, comments, cb);      steward.createGroup(name, uuid, type, operator, members, comments, cb);      steward.createTask(name, uuid, actor, perform, parameter, comments, cb);      steward.createUser(name, uuid, role, clientName, comments, cb);       steward.listActivity(activityID, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listActors(prefix, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listDevice(deviceID, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listEvent(eventID, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listGroup(groupID, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listTask(taskID, options, cb @abstr_number );      steward.listUser(userID, options, cb @abstr_number );       steward.modifyActivity(activityID, name, armed, event, task, cb);      steward.modifyGroup(groupID, name, type, operator, members, cb);       steward.performActivity(activityID, cb @abstr_number );      steward.performActor = function(prefix, perform, parameter, cb @abstr_number );      steward.performDevice(deviceID, perform, parameter, cb @abstr_number );      steward.performGroup(groupID, perform, parameter, cb @abstr_number );      steward.performTask(taskID, cb @abstr_number );       steward.deleteActivity = function(activityID, cb);      // steward.deleteDevice = function(deviceID, cb);      steward.deleteEvent = function(eventID, cb);      steward.deleteGroup = function(groupID, cb);      steward.deleteTask = function(taskID, cb);   "

Yamp can be used to parse low to medium complex DSL.   Yamp parser is the combination of other parsers - primitive (like parser for a single char) or more complex.  A simplest parser that parse just a single character:       //Parse a single char 'a'     var charParser = yamp.Char('a');     var result = yamp.Parse(charParser, 'a');   More complex parsers can be created with parser combiners functions:       //Parse a stream of chars that can contains  @abstr_number  to unlimited chars 'a'     var charStreamParser = yamp.Many(yamp.Char('a'));     var result = yamp.Parse(charStreamParser, 'aaaaa');   Yamp has fluent API to help configuring parsers:       //Parsers can be configured with method chaining     var charStreamParser = yamp.Char('a').Many();     var result = charStreamParser.Parse('aaaaa');   Unlike traditional parsers (ANTLR, yacc) yamp doesn`t have separate stages for lexical and syntax parse.

For example:  @abstr_code_section  Would run /usr/local/bin/awesome party extreme every two hours. :task is always replaced with the first argument, and any additional :whatevers are replaced with the options passed in or by variables that have been defined with set.  The default job types that ship with Whenever are defined like so:  @abstr_code_section  Pre-Rails @abstr_number apps and apps that don't use Bundler will redefine the rake and runner jobs respectively to function correctly.  If a :path is not set it will default to the directory in which whenever was executed. :environment_variable will default to 'RAILS_ENV'. :environment will default to 'production'. :output will be replaced with your output redirection settings which you can read more about here: @abstr_hyperlink  All jobs are by default run with bash -l -c 'command...'. Among other things, this allows your cron jobs to play nice with RVM by loading the entire environment instead of cron's somewhat limited environment.

435,4914,"In your ""Capfile"" file:  @abstr_code_section  Take a look at the @abstr_hyperlink (bottom of file) for options you can set.

If your deploy user is different than your application user, you can specify to set the crontab user with:  @abstr_code_section  "
435,4915,"The first thing to know about the new roles support is that it is entirely optional and backwards-compatible. If you don't need different jobs running on different servers in your capistrano deployment, then you can safely stop reading now and everything should just work the same way it always has.  When you define a job in your schedule.rb file, by default it will be deployed to all servers in the whenever_roles list (which defaults to [:db]).  However, if you want to restrict certain jobs to only run on subset of servers, you can add a :roles => [...] argument to their definitions. Make sure to add that role to the whenever_roles list in your deploy.rb.  When you run cap deploy, jobs with a :roles list specified will only be added to the crontabs on servers with one or more of the roles in that list.  Jobs with no :roles argument will be deployed to all servers in the whenever_roles list. This is to maintain backward compatibility with previous releases of whenever.  So, for example, with the default whenever_roles of [:db], a job like this would be deployed to all servers with the :db role:  @abstr_code_section  If we set whenever_roles to [:db, :app] in deploy.rb, and have the following jobs in schedule.rb:  @abstr_code_section  Here are the basic rules:  @abstr_number . If a server's role isn't listed in whenever_roles, it will _never_ have jobs added to its crontab. @abstr_number . If a server's role is listed in the whenever_roles, then it will have all jobs added to its crontab that either list that role in their :roles arg or that don't have a :roles arg. @abstr_number . If a job has a :roles arg but that role isn't in the whenever_roles list, that job _will not_ be deployed to any server.  "
435,4916,"If your production environment uses RVM (Ruby Version Manager) you will run into a gotcha that causes your cron jobs to hang. This is not directly related to Whenever, and can be tricky to debug. Your .rvmrc files must be trusted or else the cron jobs will hang waiting for the file to be trusted. A solution is to disable the prompt by adding this line to your user rvm file in ~/.rvmrc rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag= @abstr_number  This tells rvm to trust all rvmrc files.  "

A path is created from the points of the resulting convex hull. @abstr_number . This path is passed to a CustomViewOutlineProvider object that is later attached to the view itself. @abstr_number . Hence we get a convex shadow for any type of view based on its content.  P.S. : All the calculations related to graham scan are done asynchronously by default. This behavior can be controlled by calculateAsync parameter. (Thanks @abstr_hyperlink )  "

Currently the shadow is generated only for direct children of the MaterialShadowViewWrapper.

Along with the book itself, it's the closest you'll get to having your own private functional programming tutor without actually having one.  There are two main branches in this repository: - @abstr_hyperlink - @abstr_hyperlink  Be sure to select the branch which matches the edition of the book you are reading!  Here's how to use this repository:  Each chapter in the book develops a fully working library of functions and data types, built up through a series of exercises and example code given in the book text. The shell of this working library and exercise stubs live in exercises/src/main/scala/fpinscala/<chapter-description>, where <chapter-description> is a package name that corresponds to the chapter title (see below). When you begin working on a chapter, we recommend you open the exercise file(s) for that chapter, and when you encounter exercises, implement them in the exercises file and make sure they work.  If you get stuck on an exercise, let's say exercise @abstr_number in the chapter, you can find hints in answerkey/<chapter-description>/ @abstr_number .hint.txt (if no hints are available for a problem, the file will just have a single '-' as its contents) and the answer along with an explanation of the answer and any variations in answerkey/<chapter-description>/ @abstr_number .answer.scala or @abstr_number .answer.markdown. The finished Scala modules, with all answers for each chapter live in answers/src/main/scala/fpinscala/<chapter-description>. Please feel free to submit pull requests for alternate answers, improved hints, and so on, so we can make this repo the very best resource for people working through the book.

458,5184,The @abstr_hyperlink folder has basic and advanced examples. The examples within each service assume that you already have service credentials.  
458,5185,"If you run your app in IBM Cloud, the SDK gets credentials from the @abstr_hyperlink environment variable.  "
458,5186,"Watson services are migrating to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.    * With some service instances, you authenticate to the API by using IAM.   * In other instances, you authenticate by providing the username and password for the service instance.    "
458,5187,"To find out which authentication to use, view the service credentials. You find the service credentials for authentication the same way for all Watson services:  @abstr_number . Go to the IBM Cloud @abstr_hyperlink page. @abstr_number . Either click an existing Watson service instance in your @abstr_hyperlink or click @abstr_hyperlink and create a service instance. @abstr_number . Click on the Manage item in the left nav bar of your service instance.  On this page, you should be able to see your credentials for accessing your service instance.  "
458,5188,There are three ways to supply the credentials you found above to the SDK for authentication.  
458,5189,"With a credential file, you just need to put the file in the right place and the SDK will do the work of parsing and authenticating. You can get this file by clicking the Download button for the credentials in the Manage tab of your service instance.  The file downloaded will be called ibm-credentials.env. This is the name the SDK will search for and must be preserved unless you want to configure the file path (more on that later). The SDK will look for your ibm-credentials.env file in the following places (in order):    * The top-level directory of the project you're using the SDK in   * Your system's home directory    As long as you set that up correctly, you don't have to worry about setting any authentication options in your code. So, for example, if you created and downloaded the credential file for your Discovery instance, you just need to do the following:  @abstr_code_section  And that's it!  If you're using more than one service at a time in your code and get two different ibm-credentials.env files, just put the contents together in one ibm-credentials.env file and the SDK will handle assigning credentials to their appropriate services.  If you would like to configure the location/name of your credential file, you can set an environment variable called IBM_CREDENTIALS_FILE. This will take precedence over the locations specified above. Here's how you can do that:  @abstr_code_section  where <path> is something like /home/user/Downloads/<file_name>.env.  "
458,5190,"Simply set the environment variables using _ syntax. For example, using your favourite terminal, you can set environment variables for Assistant service instance:  @abstr_code_section  The credentials will be loaded from the environment automatically  @abstr_code_section  "
458,5191,"If you'd prefer to set authentication values manually in your code, the SDK supports that as well. The way you'll do this depends on what type of credentials your service instance gives you.  "
458,5192,"IBM Cloud has migrated to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. IAM authentication uses a service API key to get an access token that is passed with the call. Access tokens are valid for approximately one hour and must be regenerated.  You supply either an IAM service API key or a bearer token :    * Use the API key to have the SDK manage the lifecycle of the access token. The SDK requests an access token, ensures that the access token is valid, and refreshes it if necessary.   * Use the access token if you want to manage the lifecycle yourself. For details, see @abstr_hyperlink .   * Use a server-side to generate access tokens using your IAM API key for untrusted environments like client-side scripts. The generated access tokens will be valid for one hour and can be refreshed.    "

459,5229,"Add the following to your application's Gemfile:  @abstr_code_section  Please note that you currently must need to place Recommendable below your ORM and queueing system in the Gemfile. If you are using Sidekiq and ActiveRecord, please place gem recommendable below both gem 'rails' and gem 'sidekiq'.  After bundling, you should configure Recommendable. Do this somewhere after you've required it, but before it's actually used. For example, Rails users would create an initializer (config/initializers/recommendable.rb):  @abstr_code_section  The values listed above are the defaults. I recommend playing around with the nearest_neighbors setting. A higher value will provide more accurate recommendations at the cost of more time spent generating them.  If your application uses multiple ORMs, you must configure Recommendable to use the correct one. For example:  @abstr_code_section  Important: in case of active_record with id of type uuid, use :active_record_uuid.  "
459,5230,"In your model that will be receiving recommendations:  @abstr_code_section  To ensure that users' recommendations are processed after they rate items, make sure your bundled queue system is running:  @abstr_code_section  That's it!

@abstr_code_section c# var scope = AuditScope.Create(""Order:Update"", () => order, new { MyProperty = ""value"" }); @abstr_code_section c# var scope = AuditScope.Create(new AuditScopeOptions() { EventType = ""Order:Update"", TargetGetter = () => order, ExtraFields = new { MyProperty = ""value"" } }); @abstr_code_section c# var scope = AuditScope.Create(_ => _ .EventType(""Order:Update"") .ExtraFields(new { MyProperty = ""value"" }) .Target(() => order)); @abstr_code_section c# Order order = Db.GetOrder(orderId);

464,5301,SharpKeys is a utility that manages a Registry key that allows Windows to remap one key to any other key. Included in the application is a list of common keyboard keys and a Type Key feature to automatically recognize most keyboard keys.

How many times a day do you accidentally hit cAPS lOCK BY MISTAKE AND END UP HAVING TO GO BAck and retype stuff? For me it was at least once an hour - in fact, I used to pop off the Caps Lock key so I wouldn't hit it anymore, but I found something better in Windows XP, as well as @abstr_number , Server @abstr_number , Vista, Windows @abstr_number , Windows @abstr_number , and Windows @abstr_number . There's a little used registry hack that allows you to remap keys across a keyboard. For me, this meant that I told my computer to treat Caps Lock as if it was a shift key, which it now does.  The more I started working with other keyboard, the more I wanted to have this ability to map other keys across my keyboard, but working with the Hex numbers and having too look up scan codes could be painful... hence SharpKeys.  SharpKeys is not responsible for any of the keyboard remapping functionality - it simply exposes a Registry key that controls how Windows remaps keys and has been available to us since Windows @abstr_number . The list of keys that are included in the application are from most of the US-based keyboards that I've used over the years and is not guaranteed to be @abstr_number % complete for world keyboards.

464,5311,"Q: Does it run on Windows @abstr_number ? A: Yes!  Q: Can I remap a combination of keys to one key? A: Sadly, no. SharpKeys only remaps whole keys rather than a modified key. For example, you can remap Ctrl or C but you can't remap Ctrl+C to another key. That said, the Microsoft PowerToys tool does offer this functionality - you can learn more about their tool here: @abstr_hyperlink .  Q: Can I remap a mouse click to a new key? A: Sorry, but no. The remapping technology that Windows uses to remap your keys isn't aware of your mouse.  Q: Why can't I remap my Fn key on my [notebook or Apple] keyboard? A: Some keys simply just never get to Windows. In the case of most Fn keys, they are interpretted by the hardware and never get passed onto the OS, no matter how they appear to work... if Windows doesn't see the key, there's no way for the key to be remapped by Windows.  Q: Type a Key shows @abstr_number _ @abstr_number - can I remap this key? A: @abstr_number _ @abstr_number is a catch all code that Windows reports when a key is captured by hardware or some other driver so there's no way to successfully remap that key, especially since multiple keys can return the same @abstr_number _ @abstr_number code.  Q: Type a Key shows Unknown Key - can I remap this key? A: Odds are this is just a key that has never been seen by SharpKeys before so it doesn't know what to do with it. Open an issue on this site for this project and someone from the Open Source community can look into adding it.  Q: Type a Key shows a code that is E @abstr_number _nnnn - can I remap this key? A: If a scancode has @abstr_number characters, then it is what is known as a triple byte scancode which is something that cannot be remapped by the Windows Registry. To remap a key like this, you'll need an active remapper like Microsoft PowerToys or AutoHotKeys or the app that came with the keyboard (e.g. Logitech's Options) if available.  Q: What's all this stuff about ""scan codes""? A: Whenever you press a key on your keyboard, it sends a binary code to the keyboard controller in you PC. That code is passed on into Windows (in most cases) and Windows interprets it as ""they pressed code @abstr_number x @abstr_number A so that's Caps Lock - turn that on!"" What modern versions of Windows also does is it checks a registry key when the machine boots. What that registry key does is tell windows ""even though they pressed @abstr_number x @abstr_number A, treat it as @abstr_number x @abstr_number A"" (which is left shift). What SharpKeys does is edits this registry key using a simple UI and sidestepping the registry editor.  Q: I have a new PC that has a hang up button I want to remap - can I remap this key? A: A lot of people ask for E @abstr_number _ @abstr_number F @abstr_number but as the above question calls out, triple byte scancodes cannot be remapped with the Windows Registry. This applies to Lenovo, HP, Dell, and any other PC maker's laptop or desktop.  Q: Type a Key doesn't recognize the Alt key when I type it - how do I remap this key? A: The Alt key scancode doesn't make it through the system, to get to the Type a Key window. Basically, when you type Alt, Windows sends it to the system menu and activate it, rather than sending the scancode to the window. You can still remap this key, but you'll see to select it from the list manually; you'll find it in the grouping of keys marked as ""Special"".  Q: What is the craziest remapping you've ever done? A: I think it's my active remapping on Surface products, where some of the cursor navigation keys share space with F @abstr_number -F @abstr_number . Since I use F @abstr_number -F @abstr_number for a lot for Office or Visual Studio, I don't want to have to remember to hit Fn but I also don't want to leave Fn-Lock on because I also need Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn as well. Soooooo, I leave Fn-Lock on and then remapped F @abstr_number -F @abstr_number to Home/End/PgUp/PgDn and then Home/End/PgUp/PgDn to F @abstr_number -F @abstr_number . I also disabled Caps Lock and remapped the Right Alt to Left Windows because that's just happy for a laptop. Since other people might make use of this, I put @abstr_hyperlink .  Q: What is an ""Unknown"" key? A: There's no way I could get a lab of keyboards to test, especially when almost every modern keyboard comes with extra keys or language specific keys - some companies are even making keyboards with special buttons for their own software or product line up. Consequently, when you use Type Key and it hit a key that SharpKeys may not know about, it can still be mapped, even if the label says unknown. If there's a key that you have on your keyboard that is listed as Unknown but you have a used for it, email me and I'll see about adding a better label for it.  Q: What happens if I use your utility and I add a bunch of key mapping and I can't use my computer anymore? A: Well, more or less, you're screwed. I've tested this application a good deal, and there's very little risk in modifying this Registry entry, but if you turn off a key you need for your password, you're mostly out of luck. One option is to try using the onscreen keyboard that's available via Accessibility options, as that wouldn't be impacted by remapping settings for Windows. You can also try to plug in a USB keyboard if you're on a laptop or you can boot into Safe Mode and remove the Scancode Map Registry key, but you'll be on your own. Having said this, please be careful and you're using SharpKeys at your own risk!  Q: I have to have combo key support or triple-byte enabled keys support! Why won't you make this change?! A: There is absolutely nothing I can do about it: Windows is remapping the keys and this app is just a UX for the Registry key that controls the remapping. In fact, I think I answered this already in the FAQ. That said, if you want a deeper level of remapping support please check out @abstr_hyperlink .  "

465,5322,Our community has created a number of extensions that add functionality above and beyond what is included with Devise. You can view a list of available extensions and add your own here:  https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Extensions  
465,5323,"We hope that you will consider contributing to Devise. Please read this short overview for some information about how to get started:  https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Contributing  You will usually want to write tests for your changes. To run the test suite, go into Devise's top-level directory and run bundle install and bin/test. Devise works with multiple Ruby and Rails versions, and ActiveRecord and Mongoid ORMs, which means you can run the test suite with some modifiers: DEVISE_ORM and BUNDLE_GEMFILE.  "
465,5324,"Since Devise supports both Mongoid and ActiveRecord, we rely on this variable to run specific code for each ORM. The default value of DEVISE_ORM is active_record. To run the tests for Mongoid, you can pass mongoid: @abstr_code_section When running the tests for Mongoid, you will need to have a MongoDB server (version @abstr_number . @abstr_number or newer) running on your system.  Please note that the command output will show the variable value being used.  "
465,5325,"We can use this variable to tell bundler what Gemfile it should use (instead of the one in the current directory). Inside the @abstr_hyperlink directory, we have one for each version of Rails we support. When you send us a pull request, it may happen that the test suite breaks using some of them. If that's the case, you can simulate the same environment using the BUNDLE_GEMFILE variable. For example, if the tests broke using Ruby @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and Rails @abstr_number . @abstr_number , you can do the following: @abstr_code_section  You can also combine both of them if the tests broke for Mongoid: @abstr_code_section  "
465,5326,Devise uses @abstr_hyperlink as test framework.    * Running all tests: @abstr_code_section    * Running tests for an specific file: @abstr_code_section    * Running a specific test given a regex: @abstr_code_section     
465,5327,"If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you _do not_ use Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework.

465,5328,"Devise @abstr_number . @abstr_number works with Rails @abstr_number . @abstr_number onwards. Add the following line to your Gemfile:  @abstr_code_section  Then run bundle install  Next, you need to run the generator:  @abstr_code_section  At this point, a number of instructions will appear in the console. Among these instructions, you'll need to set up the default URL options for the Devise mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for config/environments/development.rb:  @abstr_code_section  The generator will install an initializer which describes ALL of Devise's configuration options. It is _imperative_ that you take a look at it. When you are done, you are ready to add Devise to any of your models using the generator.  In the following command you will replace MODEL with the class name used for the application’s users (it’s frequently User but could also be Admin). This will create a model (if one does not exist) and configure it with the default Devise modules. The generator also configures your config/routes.rb file to point to the Devise controller.  @abstr_code_section  Next, check the MODEL for any additional configuration options you might want to add, such as confirmable or lockable. If you add an option, be sure to inspect the migration file (created by the generator if your ORM supports them) and uncomment the appropriate section. For example, if you add the confirmable option in the model, you'll need to uncomment the Confirmable section in the migration.  Then run rails db:migrate  You should restart your application after changing Devise's configuration options (this includes stopping spring). Otherwise, you will run into strange errors, for example, users being unable to login and route helpers being undefined.  "
465,5329,"Devise will create some helpers to use inside your controllers and views. To set up a controller with user authentication, just add this before_action (assuming your devise model is 'User'):  @abstr_code_section  For Rails @abstr_number , note that protect_from_forgery is no longer prepended to the before_action chain, so if you have set authenticate_user before protect_from_forgery, your request will result in ""Can't verify CSRF token authenticity."" To resolve this, either change the order in which you call them, or use protect_from_forgery prepend: true.  If your devise model is something other than User, replace ""_user"" with ""_yourmodel"". The same logic applies to the instructions below.  To verify if a user is signed in, use the following helper:  @abstr_code_section  For the current signed-in user, this helper is available:  @abstr_code_section  You can access the session for this scope:  @abstr_code_section  After signing in a user, confirming the account or updating the password, Devise will look for a scoped root path to redirect to. For instance, when using a :user resource, the user_root_path will be used if it exists; otherwise, the default root_path will be used. This means that you need to set the root inside your routes:  @abstr_code_section  You can also override after_sign_in_path_for and after_sign_out_path_for to customize your redirect hooks.  Notice that if your Devise model is called Member instead of User, for example, then the helpers available are:  @abstr_code_section  "
465,5330,"The Devise method in your models also accepts some options to configure its modules. For example, you can choose the cost of the hashing algorithm with:  @abstr_code_section  Besides :stretches, you can define :pepper, :encryptor, :confirm_within, :remember_for, :timeout_in, :unlock_in among other options. For more details, see the initializer file that was created when you invoked the ""devise:install"" generator described above. This file is usually located at /config/initializers/devise.rb.  "
465,5331,"The Parameter Sanitizer API has changed for Devise @abstr_number :warning:  _For previous Devise versions see https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/tree/ @abstr_number -stable#strong-parameters_  When you customize your own views, you may end up adding new attributes to forms. Rails @abstr_number moved the parameter sanitization from the model to the controller, causing Devise to handle this concern at the controller as well.  There are just three actions in Devise that allow any set of parameters to be passed down to the model, therefore requiring sanitization. Their names and default permitted parameters are:    * sign_in (Devise::SessionsController#create) - Permits only the authentication keys (like email)   * sign_up (Devise::RegistrationsController#create) - Permits authentication keys plus password and password_confirmation   * account_update (Devise::RegistrationsController#update) - Permits authentication keys plus password, password_confirmation and current_password    In case you want to permit additional parameters (the lazy way™), you can do so using a simple before action in your ApplicationController:  @abstr_code_section  The above works for any additional fields where the parameters are simple scalar types. If you have nested attributes (say you're using accepts_nested_attributes_for), then you will need to tell devise about those nestings and types:  @abstr_code_section  Devise allows you to completely change Devise defaults or invoke custom behavior by passing a block:  To permit simple scalar values for username and email, use this  @abstr_code_section  If you have some checkboxes that express the roles a user may take on registration, the browser will send those selected checkboxes as an array. An array is not one of Strong Parameters' permitted scalars, so we need to configure Devise in the following way:  @abstr_code_section For the list of permitted scalars, and how to declare permitted keys in nested hashes and arrays, see  https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters#nested-parameters  If you have multiple Devise models, you may want to set up a different parameter sanitizer per model. In this case, we recommend inheriting from Devise::ParameterSanitizer and adding your own logic:  @abstr_code_section  And then configure your controllers to use it:  @abstr_code_section  The example above overrides the permitted parameters for the user to be both :username and :email. The non-lazy way to configure parameters would be by defining the before filter above in a custom controller. We detail how to configure and customize controllers in some sections below.  "
465,5332,"We built Devise to help you quickly develop an application that uses authentication. However, we don't want to be in your way when you need to customize it.  Since Devise is an engine, all its views are packaged inside the gem. These views will help you get started, but after some time you may want to change them. If this is the case, you just need to invoke the following generator, and it will copy all views to your application:  @abstr_code_section  If you have more than one Devise model in your application (such as User and Admin), you will notice that Devise uses the same views for all models. Fortunately, Devise offers an easy way to customize views. All you need to do is set config.scoped_views = true inside the config/initializers/devise.rb file.  After doing so, you will be able to have views based on the role like users/sessions/new and admins/sessions/new. If no view is found within the scope, Devise will use the default view at devise/sessions/new. You can also use the generator to generate scoped views:  @abstr_code_section  If you would like to generate only a few sets of views, like the ones for the registerable and confirmable module, you can pass a list of modules to the generator with the -v flag.  @abstr_code_section  "
465,5333,"If the customization at the views level is not enough, you can customize each controller by following these steps:  @abstr_number . Create your custom controllers using the generator which requires a scope:        @abstr_code_section      If you specify users as the scope, controllers will be created in app/controllers/users/.     And the sessions controller will look like this:       @abstr_code_section     (Use the -c flag to specify a controller, for example: rails generate devise:controllers users -c=sessions)   @abstr_number . Tell the router to use this controller:        @abstr_code_section   @abstr_number . Copy the views from devise/sessions to users/sessions. Since the controller was changed, it won't use the default views located in devise/sessions.  @abstr_number . Finally, change or extend the desired controller actions.       You can completely override a controller action:       @abstr_code_section      Or you can simply add new behavior to it:       @abstr_code_section      This is useful for triggering background jobs or logging events during certain actions.   Remember that Devise uses flash messages to let users know if sign in was successful or unsuccessful. Devise expects your application to call flash[:notice] and flash[:alert] as appropriate. Do not print the entire flash hash, print only specific keys. In some circumstances, Devise adds a :timedout key to the flash hash, which is not meant for display. Remove this key from the hash if you intend to print the entire hash.  "
465,5334,"Devise also ships with default routes. If you need to customize them, you should probably be able to do it through the devise_for method. It accepts several options like :class_name, :path_prefix and so on, including the possibility to change path names for I @abstr_number n:  @abstr_code_section  Be sure to check devise_for @abstr_hyperlink for details.  If you have the need for more deep customization, for instance to also allow ""/sign_in"" besides ""/users/sign_in"", all you need to do is create your routes normally and wrap them in a devise_scope block in the router:  @abstr_code_section  This way, you tell Devise to use the scope :user when ""/sign_in"" is accessed. Notice devise_scope is also aliased as as in your router.  Please note: You will still need to add devise_for in your routes in order to use helper methods such as current_user.  @abstr_code_section  "
465,5335,"Devise uses flash messages with I @abstr_number n, in conjunction with the flash keys :notice and :alert. To customize your app, you can set up your locale file:  @abstr_code_section  You can also create distinct messages based on the resource you've configured using the singular name given in routes:  @abstr_code_section  The Devise mailer uses a similar pattern to create subject messages:  @abstr_code_section  Take a look at our locale file to check all available messages. You may also be interested in one of the many translations that are available on our wiki:  https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/I @abstr_number n  Caution: Devise Controllers inherit from ApplicationController. If your app uses multiple locales, you should be sure to set I @abstr_number n.locale in ApplicationController.  "
465,5336,"Devise includes some test helpers for controller and integration tests. In order to use them, you need to include the respective module in your test cases/specs.  "
465,5337,"Controller tests require that you include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers on your test case or its parent ActionController::TestCase superclass. For Rails versions prior to @abstr_number , include Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers instead, since the superclass for controller tests was changed to ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest (for more details, see the Integration tests section).  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_code_section  If you're using RSpec, you can put the following inside a file named spec/support/devise.rb or in your spec/spec_helper.rb (or spec/rails_helper.rb if you are using rspec-rails):  @abstr_code_section  Just be sure that this inclusion is made _after_ the require 'rspec/rails' directive.  Now you are ready to use the sign_in and sign_out methods on your controller tests:  @abstr_code_section  If you are testing Devise internal controllers or a controller that inherits from Devise's, you need to tell Devise which mapping should be used before a request. This is necessary because Devise gets this information from the router, but since controller tests do not pass through the router, it needs to be stated explicitly. For example, if you are testing the user scope, simply use:  @abstr_code_section  "
465,5338,"Integration test helpers are available by including the Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers module.  @abstr_code_section  Now you can use the following sign_in and sign_out methods in your integration tests:  @abstr_code_section  RSpec users can include the IntegrationHelpers module on their :feature specs.  @abstr_code_section  Unlike controller tests, integration tests do not need to supply the devise.mapping env value, as the mapping can be inferred by the routes that are executed in your tests.  You can read more about testing your Rails @abstr_number - Rails @abstr_number controllers with RSpec in the wiki:    * https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Test-controllers-with-Rails-(and-RSpec)    "

465,5340,"Devise allows you to set up as many Devise models as you want. If you want to have an Admin model with just authentication and timeout features, in addition to the User model above, just run:  @abstr_code_section  Alternatively, you can simply run the Devise generator.  Keep in mind that those models will have completely different routes. They do not and cannot share the same controller for sign in, sign out and so on. In case you want to have different roles sharing the same actions, we recommend that you use a role-based approach, by either providing a role column or using a dedicated gem for authorization.  "

465,5347,"If you enable the @abstr_hyperlink module, note that a stolen password reset token could give an attacker access to your application. Devise takes effort to generate random, secure tokens, and stores only token digests in the database, never plaintext. However the default logging behavior in Rails can cause plaintext tokens to leak into log files:  @abstr_number . Action Mailer logs the entire contents of all outgoing emails to the DEBUG level. Password reset tokens delivered to users in email will be leaked. @abstr_number . Active Job logs all arguments to every enqueued job at the INFO level. If you configure Devise to use deliver_later to send password reset emails, password reset tokens will be leaked.  Rails sets the production logger level to INFO by default. Consider changing your production logger level to WARN if you wish to prevent tokens from being leaked into your logs. In config/environments/production.rb:  @abstr_code_section  "

465,5349,"Rails @abstr_number + has a built-in @abstr_hyperlink which optimizes Rails for use as an API (only). Devise is _somewhat_ able to handle applications that are built in this mode without additional modifications in the sense that it should not raise exceptions and the like. But some issues may still arise during development/testing, as we still don't know the full extent of this compatibility. (For more information, see @abstr_hyperlink )  "
465,5350,"API-only applications don't support browser-based authentication via cookies, which is devise's default. Yet, devise can still provide authentication out of the box in those cases with the http_authenticatable strategy, which uses HTTP Basic Auth and authenticates the user on each request. (For more info, see this wiki article for @abstr_hyperlink )  The devise default for HTTP Auth is disabled, so it will need to be enabled in the devise initializer for the database strategy:  @abstr_code_section  This restriction does not limit you from implementing custom warden strategies, either in your application or via gem-based extensions for devise. A common authentication strategy for APIs is token-based authentication. For more information on extending devise to support this type of authentication and others, see the wiki article for @abstr_hyperlink or this blog post on @abstr_hyperlink .  "
465,5351,"API Mode changes the order of the middleware stack, and this can cause problems for Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers. This problem usually surfaces as an undefined method[]=' for nil:NilClasserror when using integration test helpers, such as#sign_in`. The solution is simply to reorder the middlewares by adding the following to test.rb:  @abstr_code_section  For a deeper understanding of this, review @abstr_hyperlink .  Additionally be mindful that without views supported, some email-based flows from Confirmable, Recoverable and Lockable are not supported directly at this time.  "

466,5361,"Ktorm provides a set of APIs named _Entity Sequence_ , which can be used to obtain entity objects from databases. As the name implies, its style and use pattern are highly similar to the sequence APIs in Kotlin standard lib, as it provides many extension functions with the same names, such as filter, map, reduce, etc.  Most of the entity sequence APIs are provided as extension functions, which can be divided into two groups, they are intermediate operations and terminal operations.  "
466,5362,"These functions don’t execute the internal queries but return new-created sequence objects applying some modifications. For example, the filter function creates a new sequence object with the filter condition given by its parameter. The following code obtains all the employees in department @abstr_number by using filter:  @abstr_code_section  We can see that the usage is almost the same as kotlin.sequences, the only difference is the == in the lambda is replaced by the eq function. The filter function can also be called continuously, as all the filter conditions are combined with the and operator.  @abstr_code_section  Generated SQL:  @abstr_code_section  Use sortedBy or soretdByDescending to sort entities in a sequence:  @abstr_code_section  Use drop and take for pagination:  @abstr_code_section  "
466,5363,"Terminal operations of entity sequences execute the queries right now, then obtain the query results and perform some calculations on them. The for-each loop is a typical terminal operation, and the following code uses it to print all employees in the sequence:  @abstr_code_section  Generated SQL:  @abstr_code_section  The toCollection functions (including toList, toSet, etc.) are used to collect all the elements into a collection:  @abstr_code_section  The mapColumns function is used to obtain the results of a column:  @abstr_code_section  Additionally, if we want to select two or more columns, we just need to wrap our selected columns by tupleOf in the closure, and the function’s return type becomes List<TupleN<C @abstr_number ?, C @abstr_number ?, .. Cn?>>.  @abstr_code_section  Generated SQL:  @abstr_code_section  Other familiar functions are also supported, such as fold, reduce, forEach, etc. The following code calculates the total salary of all employees:  @abstr_code_section  "
466,5364,"The entity sequence APIs not only allow us to obtain entities from databases just like using kotlin.sequences, but they also provide rich support for aggregations, so we can conveniently count the columns, sum them, or calculate their averages, etc.  The following code obtains the max salary in department @abstr_number :  @abstr_code_section  Also, if we want to aggregate two or more columns, we just need to wrap our aggregate expressions by tupleOf in the closure, and the function’s return type becomes TupleN<C @abstr_number ?, C @abstr_number ?, ..

The example below obtains the average and the range of salaries in department @abstr_number :  @abstr_code_section  Generated SQL:  @abstr_code_section  Ktorm also provides many convenient helper functions implemented based on aggregateColumns, they are count, any, none, all, sumBy, maxBy, minBy, averageBy.  The following code obtains the max salary in department @abstr_number using maxBy instead:  @abstr_code_section  Additionally, grouping aggregations are also supported, we just need to call groupingBy before calling aggregateColumns.

476,5462,"TL; DR. Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector. It mitigates the high complexity and slow convergence issues of DETR via a novel sampling-based efficient attention mechanism.  @abstr_image  @abstr_image  Abstract. DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However, it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with @abstr_number × less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.  "

By default, this is limited to @abstr_number mb. To customize the size of the cache or the max age for cached items, use the format memory:size:age where size is measured in mb and age is a duration. For example, memory: @abstr_number : @abstr_number h will create a @abstr_number mb cache that will cache items no longer than @abstr_number hours.   * directory on local disk (e.g. /tmp/imageproxy) - will cache images on disk    * s @abstr_number URL (e.g. s @abstr_number ://region/bucket-name/optional-path-prefix) - will cache images on Amazon S @abstr_number . This requires either an IAM role and instance profile with access to your your bucket or AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY environmental variables be set. (Additional methods of loading credentials are documented in the @abstr_hyperlink ).  Additional configuration options ( @abstr_hyperlink ) may be specified as URL query string parameters, which are mostly useful when working with s @abstr_number -compatible services:      * ""endpoint"" - specify an alternate API endpoint     * ""disableSSL"" - set to "" @abstr_number "" to disable SSL when calling the API     * ""s @abstr_number ForcePathStyle"" - set to "" @abstr_number "" to force the request to use path-style addressing  For example, when working with @abstr_hyperlink , which doesn't use regions, provide a dummy region value and custom endpoint value:  s @abstr_number ://fake-region/bucket/folder?endpoint=minio: @abstr_number &disableSSL= @abstr_number &s @abstr_number ForcePathStyle= @abstr_number  Similarly, for @abstr_hyperlink , provide a dummy region value and the appropriate endpoint for your space:  s @abstr_number ://fake-region/bucket/folder?endpoint=sfo @abstr_number .digitaloceanspaces.com    * gcs URL (e.g. gcs://bucket-name/optional-path-prefix) - will cache images on Google Cloud Storage. Authentication is documented in Google's @abstr_hyperlink .    * azure URL (e.g. azure://container-name/) - will cache images on Azure Storage. This requires AZURESTORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME and AZURESTORAGE_ACCESS_KEY environment variables to bet set.   * redis URL (e.g. redis://hostname/) - will cache images on the specified redis host. The full URL syntax is defined by the @abstr_hyperlink . Rather than specify password in the URI, use the REDIS_PASSWORD environment variable.    For example, to cache files on disk in the /tmp/imageproxy directory:       imageproxy -cache /tmp/imageproxy   Reload the @abstr_hyperlink , and then inspect the contents of /tmp/imageproxy. Within the subdirectories, there should be two files, one for the original full-size codercat image, and one for the resized @abstr_number px version.  Multiple caches can be specified by separating them by spaces or by repeating the -cache flag multiple times. The caches will be created in a [tiered fashion][]. Typically this is used to put a smaller and faster in-memory cache in front of a larger but slower on-disk cache. For example, the following will first check an in-memory cache for an image, followed by a gcs bucket:       imageproxy -cache memory -cache gcs://my-bucket/   "
481,5531,"You can limit images to only be accessible for certain hosts in the HTTP referrer header, which can help prevent others from hotlinking to images. It can be enabled by running:       imageproxy  -referrers example.com   Reload the @abstr_hyperlink , and you should now get an error message. You can specify multiple hosts as a comma separated list, or prefix a host value with *. to allow all sub-domains as well.  "
481,5532,"You can limit the remote hosts that the proxy will fetch images from using the allowHosts and denyHosts flags. This is useful, for example, for locking the proxy down to your own hosts to prevent others from abusing it. Of course if you want to support fetching from any host, leave off these flags.  Try it out by running:       imageproxy -allowHosts example.com   Reload the @abstr_hyperlink , and you should now get an error message. Alternately, try running:       imageproxy -denyHosts octodex.github.com   Reloading the @abstr_hyperlink will still return an error message.  You can specify multiple hosts as a comma separated list to either flag, or prefix a host value with *. to allow or deny all sub-domains. You can also specify a netblock in CIDR notation (@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number / @abstr_number) -- this is useful for blocking reserved ranges like @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number / @abstr_number, @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number / @abstr_number, etc.  If a host matches both an allowed and denied host, the request will be denied.  "
481,5533,"You can limit what content types can be proxied by using the contentTypes flag. By default, this is set to image/*, meaning that imageproxy will process any image types. You can specify multiple content types as a comma separated list, and suffix values with * to perform a wildcard match. Set the flag to an empty string to proxy all requests, regardless of content type.  "
481,5534,"Instead of an allowed host list, you can require that requests be signed. This is useful in preventing abuse when you don't have just a static list of hosts you want to allow. Signatures are generated using HMAC-SHA @abstr_number against the remote URL, and url-safe base @abstr_number encoding the result:       base @abstr_number urlencode(hmac.New(sha @abstr_number , ).digest())   The HMAC key is specified using the signatureKey flag. If this flag begins with an ""@"", the remainder of the value is interpreted as a file on disk which contains the HMAC key.  Try it out by running:       imageproxy -signatureKey ""secretkey""   Reload the @abstr_hyperlink , and you should see an error message. Now load a @abstr_hyperlink (which contains the @abstr_hyperlink ) and verify that it loads properly.  Some simple code samples for generating signatures in various languages can be found in docs/url-signing.md. Multiple valid signature keys may be provided to support key rotation by repeating the signatureKey flag multiple times, or by providing a space-separated list of keys. To use a key with a literal space character, load the key from a file using the ""@"" prefix documented above.  If both a whiltelist and signatureKey are specified, requests can match either. In other words, requests that match one of the allowed hosts don't necessarily need to be signed, though they can be.  "
481,5535,"Typically, remote images to be proxied are specified as absolute URLs. However, if you commonly proxy images from a single source, you can provide a base URL and then specify remote images relative to that base. Try it out by running:       imageproxy -baseURL https://octodex.github.com/   Then load the codercat image, specified as a URL relative to that base: . Note that this is not an effective method to mask the true source of the images being proxied; it is trivial to discover the base URL being used. Even when a base URL is specified, you can always provide the absolute URL of the image to be proxied.  "
481,5536,"By default, the imageproxy won't scale images beyond their original size. However, you can use the scaleUp command-line flag to allow this to happen:       imageproxy -scaleUp true   "
481,5537,"Imageproxy can proxy remote webp images, but they will be served in either jpeg or png format (this is because the golang webp library only supports webp decoding) if any transformation is requested. If no format is specified, imageproxy will use jpeg by default. If no transformation is requested (for example, if you are just using imageproxy as an SSL proxy) then the original webp image will be served as-is without any format conversion.  Because so few browsers support tiff images, they will be converted to jpeg by default if any transformation is requested. To force encoding as tiff, pass the ""tiff"" option. Like webp, tiff images will be served as-is without any format conversion if no transformation is requested.  Run imageproxy -help for a complete list of flags the command accepts. If you want to use a different caching implementation, it's probably easiest to just make a copy of cmd/imageproxy/main.go and customize it to fit your needs... it's a very simple command.  "
481,5538,"All configuration flags have equivalent environment variables of the form IMAGEPROXY_$NAME. For example, an on-disk cache could be configured by calling       IMAGEPROXY_CACHE=""/tmp/imageproxy"" imageproxy   "
481,5539,"In most cases, you can follow the normal procedure for building a deploying any go application. For example:    * go build willnorris.com/go/imageproxy/cmd/imageproxy   * copy resulting binary to /usr/local/bin   * copy etc/imageproxy.service to /lib/systemd/system and enable using systemctl.    Instructions have been contributed below for running on other platforms, but I don't have much experience with them personally.  "

488,5597,Remember: all functions (except version and time) are implemented as asynchronous functions! There are now three ways to consume them:  Callback Style  @abstr_code_section  
488,5598,"Promises Style is new in version @abstr_number . @abstr_number .  When omitting callback parameter (cb), then you can use all function in a promise oriented way. All functions (except of version and time) are returning a promise, that you can consume:  @abstr_code_section  "
488,5599,Using async / await (available since node v @abstr_number . @abstr_number )  Since node v @abstr_number . @abstr_number you can also use the async / await pattern. The above example would then look like this:  @abstr_code_section

488,5601,"To be able to measure temperature on macOS I created a little additional package. Due to some difficulties in NPM with optionalDependencies I unfortunately was getting unexpected warnings on other platforms. So I decided to drop this optional dependency for macOS - so by default, you will not get correct values.  This additional package will unfortunately NOT work on Apple Silicon M @abstr_number machines.  But if you need to detect macOS temperature just run the following additional installation command:  @abstr_code_section  systeminformation will then detect this additional library and return the temperature when calling systeminformations standard function cpuTemperature()  "
488,5602,"wmic - which is used to determine temperature and battery sometimes needs to be run with admin privileges. So if you do not get any values, try to run it again with according privileges. If you still do not get any values, your system might not support this feature. In some cases we also discovered that wmic returned incorrect temperature values.  "
488,5603,In some cases you need to install the Linux sensors package to be able to measure temperature e.g. on DEBIAN based systems by running sudo apt-get install lm-sensors  
488,5604,To be able to detect S.M.A.R.T. status on Linux you need to install smartmontools. On DEBIAN based Linux distributions you can install it by running sudo apt-get install smartmontools  
488,5605,"In fsStats(), disksIO() and networkStats() the results / sec. values (rx_sec, IOPS, ...) are calculated correctly beginning with the second call of the function. It is determined by calculating the difference of transferred bytes / IOs divided by the time between two calls of the function.  The first time you are calling one of these functions, you will get - @abstr_number for transfer rates. The second time, you should then get statistics based on the time between the two calls ...  So basically, if you e.g. need a value for network stats every second, your code should look like this:  @abstr_code_section  Beginning with the second call, you get network transfer values per second.

495,5668,"During ordinary development, a new Scala build is built by the previously released version, known as the ""reference compiler"" or, slangily, as ""STARR"" (stable reference release). Building with STARR is sufficient for most kinds of changes.  However, a full build of Scala is _bootstrapped_. Bootstrapping has two steps: first, build with STARR; then, build again using the freshly built compiler, leaving STARR behind. This guarantees that every Scala version can build itself.  If you change the code generation part of the Scala compiler, your changes will only show up in the bytecode of the library and compiler after a bootstrap. Our CI does a bootstrapped build.  Bootstrapping locally : To perform a bootstrap, run restarrFull within an sbt session. This will build and publish the Scala distribution to your local artifact repository and then switch sbt to use that version as its new scalaVersion. You may then revert back with reload. Note restarrFull will also write the STARR version to buildcharacter.properties so you can switch back to it with restarr without republishing. This will switch the sbt session to use the build-restarr and target-restarr directories instead of build and target, which avoids wiping out classfiles and incremental metadata. IntelliJ will continue to be configured to compile and run tests using the starr version in versions.properties.  For history on how the current scheme was arrived at, see https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/gp @abstr_number JsM @abstr_number E @abstr_number Fo/discussion.  Building with fatal warnings : To make warnings in the project fatal (i.e. turn them into errors), run set Global / fatalWarnings := true in sbt (replace Global with the name of a module—such as reflect—to only make warnings fatal for that module). To disable fatal warnings again, either reload sbt, or run set Global / fatalWarnings := false (again, replace Global with the name of a module if you only enabled fatal warnings for that module). CI always has fatal warnings enabled.  "
495,5669,"Once you've started an sbt session you can run one of the core commands:    * compile compiles all sub-projects (library, reflect, compiler, scaladoc, etc)   * scala / scalac run the REPL / compiler directly from sbt (accept options / arguments)   * enableOptimizer reloads the build with the Scala optimizer enabled. Our releases are built this way. Enable this when working on compiler performance improvements. When the optimizer is enabled the build will be slower and incremental builds can be incorrect.   * setupPublishCore runs enableOptimizer and configures a version number based on the current Git SHA. Often used as part of bootstrapping: sbt setupPublishCore publishLocal && sbt -Dstarr.version=<VERSION> testAll   * dist/mkBin generates runner scripts (scala, scalac, etc) in build/quick/bin   * dist/mkPack creates a build in the Scala distribution format in build/pack   * junit/test runs the JUnit tests; junit/testOnly *Foo runs a subset   * scalacheck/test runs scalacheck tests, use testOnly to run a subset   * partest runs partest tests (accepts options, try partest --help)   * publishLocal publishes a distribution locally (can be used as scalaVersion in other sbt projects)     * Optionally set baseVersionSuffix := ""bin-abcd @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT"" where abcd @abstr_number is the git hash of the revision being published. You can also use something custom like ""bin-mypatch"". This changes the version number from @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT to something more stable (@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -bin-abcd @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT).     * Note that the -bin string marks the version binary compatible. Using it in sbt will cause the scalaBinaryVersion to be @abstr_number . @abstr_number. If the version is not binary compatible, we recommend using -pre, e.g., @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -pre-abcd @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT.     * Optionally set publishArtifact in (Compile, packageDoc) in ThisBuild := false to skip generating / publishing API docs (speeds up the process).    If a command results in an error message like a module is not authorized to depend on itself, it may be that a global sbt plugin is causing a cyclical dependency. Try disabling global sbt plugins (perhaps by temporarily commenting them out in ~/.sbt/ @abstr_number . @abstr_number /plugins/plugins.sbt).  "
495,5670,We recommend keeping local test files in the sandbox directory which is listed in the .gitignore of the Scala repo.  
495,5671,"Note that sbt's incremental compilation is often too coarse for the Scala compiler codebase and re-compiles too many files, resulting in long build times (check @abstr_hyperlink for progress on that front). In the meantime you can: - Use IntelliJ IDEA for incremental compiles (see IDE Setup below) - its incremental compiler is a bit less conservative, but usually correct.  "
495,5672,"We suggest using IntelliJ IDEA (see src/intellij/README.md).  @abstr_hyperlink may also work, but we don't yet have instructions or sample configuration for that. A pull request in this area would be exceedingly welcome. In the meantime, we are collecting guidance at @abstr_hyperlink .  In order to use IntelliJ's incremental compiler: - run dist/mkBin in sbt to get a build and the runner scripts in build/quick/bin - run ""Build"" - ""Make Project"" in IntelliJ  Now you can edit and build in IntelliJ and use the scripts (compiler, REPL) to directly test your changes. You can also run the scala, scalac and partest commands in sbt. Enable ""Ant mode"" (explained above) to prevent sbt's incremental compiler from re-compiling (too many) files before each partest invocation.  "

495,5674,"@abstr_hyperlink  Once you submit a PR your commits will be automatically tested by the Scala CI.  Our CI setup is always evolving. See @abstr_hyperlink for more details on how things currently work and how we expect they might change.  If you see a spurious failure on Jenkins, you can post /rebuild as a PR comment. The @abstr_hyperlink lists all available commands.  If you'd like to test your patch before having everything polished for review, you can have Travis CI build your branch (make sure you have a fork and have Travis CI enabled for branch builds on it first, and then push your branch). Also feel free to submit a draft PR. In case your draft branch contains a large number of commits (that you didn't clean up / squash yet for review), consider adding [ci: last-only] to the PR title. That way only the last commit will be tested, saving some energy and CI-resources. Note that inactive draft PRs will be closed eventually, which does not mean the change is being rejected.  CI performs a compiler bootstrap. The first task, validatePublishCore, publishes a build of your commit to the temporary repository https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/artifactory/scala-pr-validation-snapshots. Note that this build is not yet bootstrapped, its bytecode is built using the current STARR. The version number is @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -bin-abcd @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT where abcd @abstr_number is the commit hash. For binary incompatible builds, the version number is @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -pre-abcd @abstr_number -SNAPSHOT.  You can use Scala builds in the validation repository locally by adding a resolver and specifying the corresponding scalaVersion:  @abstr_code_section  "

495,5677,"The Scala community build is an important method for testing Scala releases. A community build can be launched for any Scala commit, even before the commit's PR has been merged. That commit is then used to build a large number of open-source projects from source and run their test suites.

499,5709,See INSTALL.md.  
499,5710,"As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. This color can be changed by setting the ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE variable. See configuration.  If you press the → key (forward-char widget) or End (end-of-line widget) with the cursor at the end of the buffer, it will accept the suggestion, replacing the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion.  If you invoke the forward-word widget, it will partially accept the suggestion up to the point that the cursor moves to.  "
499,5711,"You may want to override the default global config variables. Default values of these variables can be found here.  Note: If you are using Oh My Zsh, you can put this configuration in a file in the $ZSH_CUSTOM directory. See their comments on @abstr_hyperlink .  "
499,5712,"Set ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE to configure the style that the suggestion is shown with. The default is fg= @abstr_number, which will set the foreground color to color @abstr_number from the @abstr_hyperlink . If your terminal only supports @abstr_number colors, you will need to use a number between @abstr_number and @abstr_number .  Background color can also be set, and the suggestion can be styled bold, underlined, or standout. For example, this would show suggestions with bold, underlined, pink text on a cyan background:  @abstr_code_section  For more info, read the Character Highlighting section of the zsh manual: man zshzle or @abstr_hyperlink .  Note: Some iTerm @abstr_number users have reported @abstr_hyperlink . If this affects you, the problem is likely caused by incorrect color settings. In order to correct this, go into iTerm @abstr_number 's setting, navigate to profile > colors and make sure that the colors for Basic Colors > Background and ANSI Colors > Bright Black are different.  "
499,5713,"ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY is an array that specifies how suggestions should be generated. The strategies in the array are tried successively until a suggestion is found. There are currently three built-in strategies to choose from:    * history: Chooses the most recent match from history.   * completion: Chooses a suggestion based on what tab-completion would suggest. (requires zpty module)   * match_prev_cmd: Like history, but chooses the most recent match whose preceding history item matches the most recently executed command (more info). Note that this strategy won't work as expected with ZSH options that don't preserve the history order such as HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS or HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST.    For example, setting ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY=(history completion) will first try to find a suggestion from your history, but, if it can't find a match, will find a suggestion from the completion engine.  "
499,5714,This plugin works by triggering custom behavior when certain @abstr_hyperlink are invoked. You can add and remove widgets from these arrays to change the behavior of this plugin:    * ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS: Widgets in this array will clear the suggestion when invoked.   * ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS: Widgets in this array will accept the suggestion when invoked.   * ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_EXECUTE_WIDGETS: Widgets in this array will execute the suggestion when invoked.   * ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_PARTIAL_ACCEPT_WIDGETS: Widgets in this array will partially accept the suggestion when invoked.   * ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_IGNORE_WIDGETS: Widgets in this array will not trigger any custom behavior.    Widgets that modify the buffer and are not found in any of these arrays will fetch a new suggestion after they are invoked.  Note: A widget shouldn't belong to more than one of the above arrays.  
499,5715,"Set ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE to an integer value to disable autosuggestion for large buffers. The default is unset, which means that autosuggestion will be tried for any buffer size. Recommended value is @abstr_number . This can be useful when pasting large amount of text in the terminal, to avoid triggering autosuggestion for strings that are too long.  "
499,5716,"Suggestions are fetched asynchronously by default in zsh versions @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and greater. To disable asynchronous suggestions and fetch them synchronously instead, unset ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_USE_ASYNC after sourcing the plugin.  Alternatively, if you are using a version of zsh older than @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and want to enable asynchronous mode, set the ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_USE_ASYNC variable after sourcing the plugin (it can be set to anything). Note that there is @abstr_hyperlink in versions of zsh older than @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number where ctrl + c will fail to reset the prompt immediately after fetching a suggestion asynchronously.  "
499,5717,"Set ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_MANUAL_REBIND (it can be set to anything) to disable automatic widget re-binding on each precmd. This can be a big boost to performance, but you'll need to handle re-binding yourself if any of the widget lists change or if you or another plugin wrap any of the autosuggest widgets. To re-bind widgets, run _zsh_autosuggest_bind_widgets.  "
499,5718,"Set ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HISTORY_IGNORE to a @abstr_hyperlink to prevent offering suggestions for history entries that match the pattern.

505,5761,A Light is composed of a @abstr_number D position Vector and @abstr_number Color objects defining its ambient & diffuse emissions. These color channels interact with the Material of a Mesh to calculate the color of a Triangle.  
505,5762,"A Triangle is constructed from _* @abstr_number Vertices_ * which each define the x, y and z coordinates of a corner. Based on these _* @abstr_number Vertices , a forth *_ @abstr_number D Vector is automatically derived at the center of the Triangle – this is known as its @abstr_hyperlink . Alongside the Centroid , a fifth @abstr_hyperlink Vector is automatically calculated which defines the surface @abstr_hyperlink . The Normal describes the direction that the Triangle is facing.  "
505,5763,Geometry is simply a collection of triangles – nothing more.  
505,5764,A Material is composed of @abstr_number Color objects which define the ambient & diffuse properties of a _surface_.  
505,5765,A Mesh is constructed from a Geometry object and a Material object. All the Triangles within the Geometry are rendered using the properties of the Material.  
505,5766,A Scene sits at the very top of the stack. It simply manages arrays of Mesh & Light objects.  
505,5767,"The Renderer takes all the information in a Scene and renders it to a context. Currently FSS supports WebGL , Canvas @abstr_number D and SVG.  "
505,5768,"For every Triangle in a Scene the following calculation is performed:  @abstr_number . A Vector between the Triangle's Centroid and the Light's Position is calculated and @abstr_hyperlink . This can be considered as a single Ray travelling from the Light to the center of the Triangle. @abstr_number . The angle beween this Ray and the Normal of the Triangle is then calculated using the @abstr_hyperlink . This angle is simply a number ranging from - @abstr_number to @abstr_number . When the Ray and the Normal are coincident, this value is @abstr_number , and when they are perpendicular to one another, this value is @abstr_number . This value goes into the negative range when the Light is behind the Triangle. @abstr_number . Firstly, the diffuse color of the Light is multiplied by the diffuse color of the Material associated with the Triangle. This color is then multiplied by the coincidence angle described above. For example, if the diffuse color of the Light is #FFFFFF { R: @abstr_number , G: @abstr_number , B: @abstr_number } and the diffuse color of the Material is #FF @abstr_number _{ R: @abstr_number , G: @abstr_number , B: @abstr_number }, the combined color would be #FF @abstr_number { R: @abstr_number * @abstr_number = @abstr_number , G: @abstr_number * @abstr_number = @abstr_number , B: @abstr_number * @abstr_number = @abstr_number }. If the coincidence angle was @abstr_number . @abstr_number , the final color of the Triangle would be *_# @abstr_number _{ R: @abstr_number * @abstr_number . @abstr_number = @abstr_number . @abstr_number , G: @abstr_number * @abstr_number . @abstr_number = @abstr_number , B: @abstr_number * @abstr_number . @abstr_number = @abstr_number }. @abstr_number . In much the same way as above, the *_ambient color of the Light is multipled by the ambient color of the Material. Since ambient light is a uniform dissipation of scattered light, it is not modified any further. @abstr_number . The final color of the Triangle is simply calculated by adding the diffuse & ambient colors together. Simples.  "

It has evolved substantially since that point, but all credit goes to him for the initial tagging functionality that so many people have used.  For instance, in a social network, a user might have tags that are called skills, interests, sports, and more. There is no real way to differentiate between tags and so an implementation of this type is not possible with acts as taggable on steroids.  Enter Acts as Taggable On. Rather than tying functionality to a specific keyword (namely tags), acts as taggable on allows you to specify an arbitrary number of tag ""contexts"" that can be used locally or in combination in the same way steroids was used.

510,5849,"If you are using Overcommit on Windows , make sure you include the ffi gem in your list of dependencies. Overcommit does not include the ffi gem by default since it significantly increases the install time for non-Windows platforms.  "
510,5850,"Some hooks have third-party dependencies. For example, to lint your @abstr_hyperlink files, you're going to need the @abstr_hyperlink .  Depending on the hooks you enable/disable for your repository, you'll need to ensure your development environment already has those dependencies installed. Most hooks will display a warning if a required executable isn't available.  If you are using Bundler to manage your Ruby gem dependencies, you'll likely want to use the gemfile option to control which gem versions are available during your hook runs.  "
510,5851,"overcommit is installed via @abstr_hyperlink . It is strongly recommended that your environment support running gem install without requiring root user privileges via sudo or otherwise. Using a Ruby version manager like @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink is recommended.  Once you have an environment that allows you to install gems without sudo, run:  @abstr_code_section  You can then run the overcommit command to install hooks into repositories.  @abstr_code_section  After running overcommit --install, any existing hooks for your repository which Overcommit will replace will be backed up. You can restore everything to the way it was by running overcommit --uninstall.  "
510,5852,"If you want to use overcommit for all repositories you create/clone going forward, add the following to automatically run in your shell environment:  @abstr_code_section  The GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR provides a directory for Git to use as a template for automatically populating the .git directory. If you have your own template directory, you might just want to copy the contents of overcommit --template-dir to that directory.  "
510,5853,"Once you've installed the hooks via overcommit --install, they will automatically run when the appropriate hook is triggered.  The overcommit executable supports the following command-line flags:  Command Line Flag | Description --------------------------|---------------------------------------------------- -i/--install | Install Overcommit hooks in a repository -u/--uninstall | Remove Overcommit hooks from a repository -f/--force | Don't bail on install if other hooks already exist--overwrite them -l/--list-hooks | Display all available hooks in the current repository -r/--run | Run pre-commit hook against all tracked files in repository -t/--template-dir | Print location of template directory -h/--help | Show command-line flag documentation -v/--version | Show version  "
510,5854,"Sometimes a hook will report an error that for one reason or another you'll want to ignore. To prevent these errors from blocking your commit, you can include the name of the relevant hook in the SKIP environment variable, e.g.  @abstr_code_section  If you would prefer to specify a whitelist of hooks rather than a blacklist, use the ONLY environment variable instead.  @abstr_code_section  Use this feature sparingly, as there is no point to having the hook in the first place if you're just going to ignore it. If you want to ensure a hook is never skipped, set the required option to true in its configuration. If you attempt to skip it, you'll see a warning telling you that the hook is required, and the hook will still run.  "
510,5855,"If you have scripts that execute git commands where you don't want Overcommit hooks to run, you can disable Overcommit entirely by setting the OVERCOMMIT_DISABLE environment variable.  @abstr_code_section  "
510,5856,"Overcommit automatically colorizes its output based on whether it is outputting to a TTY. However, you can manually enable/disable color by setting the OVERCOMMIT_COLOR environment variable.  @abstr_code_section  "
510,5857,"You can run the same set of hooks that would be executed in a pre-commit hook against your entire repository by running overcommit --run. This makes it easy to have the checks verified by a CI service such as @abstr_hyperlink , including custom hooks you've written yourself.  The --run flag works by creating a pre-commit context that assumes _all_ the files in your repository have changed, and follows the same rules as a normal pre-commit check. If any hook fails with an error, it will return a non-zero exit code.  "
510,5858,"Overcommit provides a flexible configuration system that allows you to tailor the built-in hooks to suit your workflow. All configuration specific to a repository is stored in .overcommit.yml in the top-level directory of the repository.  When writing your own configuration, it will automatically extend the default configuration, so you only need to specify your configuration with respect to the default. In order to enable/disable hooks, you can add the following to your repo-specific configuration file:  @abstr_code_section  "
510,5859,"Individual hooks expose both built-in configuration options as well as their own custom options unique to each hook. The following table lists all built-in configuration options:  Option | Description ----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------- enabled | If false, this hook will never be run required | If true, this hook cannot be skipped via the SKIP environment variable quiet | If true, this hook does not display any output unless it warns/fails description | Message displayed while hook is running. requires_files | If true, this hook runs only if files that are applicable to it have been modified. See include and exclude for how to specify applicable files. include | File paths or glob patterns of files that apply to this hook. The hook will only run on the applicable files when they have been modified. Note that the concept of modified varies for different types of hooks. By default, include matches every file until you specify a list of patterns. exclude | File paths or glob patterns of files that do not apply to this hook. This is used to exclude any files that would have been matched by include. exclude_branches | List of branch names or glob patterns of branches that this hook should not run against. exclude_remotes | _PrePush hooks only._ List of remote names that the hook should not run against. include_remote_ref_deletions | _PrePush hooks only._ By default, PrePush hooks will not run for pushes that delete a remote ref (i.e. branches or tags). Set to true to have the hook run even for deleted remote ref. problem_on_unmodified_line | How to treat errors reported on lines that weren't modified during the action captured by this hook (e.g. for pre-commit hooks, warnings/errors reported on lines that were not staged with git add may not be warnings/errors you care about). Valid values are report: report errors/warnings as-is regardless of line location (default); warn: report errors as warnings if they are on lines you didn't modify; and ignore: don't display errors/warnings at all if they are on lines you didn't modify (ignore is _not_ recommended). on_fail | Change the status of a failed hook to warn or pass. This allows you to treat failures as warnings or potentially ignore them entirely, but you should use caution when doing so as you might be hiding important information. on_warn | Similar to on_fail, change the status of a hook that returns a warning status to either pass (you wish to silence warnings entirely) or fail (you wish to treat all warnings as errors). required_executable | Name of an executable that must exist in order for the hook to run. If this is a path (e.g. ./bin/ruby), ensures that the executable file exists at the given location relative to the repository root. Otherwise, if it just the name of an executable (e.g. ruby) checks if the executable can be found in one of the directories in the PATH environment variable. Set this to a specific path if you want to always use an executable that is stored in your repository. (e.g. RubyGems bin stubs, Node.js binaries, etc.) required_library/required_libraries | List of Ruby libraries to load with Kernel.require before the hook runs. This is specifically for hooks that integrate with external Ruby libraries. command | Array of arguments to use as the command. How each hook uses this is different, but it allows hooks to change the context with which they run. For example, you can change the command to be ['bundle', 'exec', 'rubocop'] instead of just rubocop so that you can use the gem versions specified in your local Gemfile.lock. This defaults to the name of the required_executable. flags | Array of arguments to append to the command. This is useful for customizing the behavior of a tool. It's also useful when a newer version of a tool removes/renames existing flags, so you can update the flags via your .overcommit.yml instead of waiting for an upstream fix in Overcommit. env | Hash of environment variables the hook should be run with. This is intended to be used as a last resort when an executable a hook runs is configured only via an environment variable. Any pre-existing environment variables with the same names as ones defined in env will have their original values restored after the hook runs. NOTE: Currently, only strings are accepted values. Boolean values will raise an error. WARNING : If you set the same environment variable for multiple hooks and you've enabled parallel hook runs, since the environment is shared across all threads you could accidentally have these separate hooks trample on each other. In this case, you should disable parallelization for the hook using the parallelize option. parallelize | Whether to allow this hook to be run concurrently with other hooks. Disable this if the hook requires access to a shared resource that other hooks may also access and modify (e.g. files, the git index, process environment variables, etc). processors | The number of processing units to reserve for this hook. This does not reserve CPUs, but indicates that out of the total number of possible concurrent hooks allowed by the global concurrency option, this hook requires the specified number. Thus in the typical case where concurrency is set to the number of available cores (default), and you have a hook that executes an application which itself creates @abstr_number threads (or is otherwise scheduled on @abstr_number cores), you can indicate that Overcommit should allocate @abstr_number processors to the hook. Ideally this means your hooks won't put undue load on your available cores. install_command | Command the user can run to install the required_executable (or alternately the specified required_libraries). This is intended for documentation purposes, as Overcommit does not install software on your behalf since there are too many edge cases where such behavior would result in incorrectly configured installations (e.g. installing a Python package in the global package space instead of in a virtual environment). skip_file_checkout | Whether to skip this hook for file checkouts (e.g. git checkout some-ref -- file). Only applicable to PostCheckout hooks. skip_if | Array of arguments to be executed to determine whether or not the hook should run. For example, setting this to a value of ['bash', '-c', '! which my-executable'] would allow you to skip running this hook if my-executable was not in the bin path.  In addition to the built-in configuration options, each hook can expose its own unique configuration options. The AuthorEmail hook, for example, allows you to customize the regex used to check commit author emails via the pattern option—useful if you want to enforce that developers use a company email address for their commits. This provides incredible flexibility for hook authors as you can make your hooks sufficiently generic and then customize them on a per-project basis.  "
510,5860,"Hook configurations are organized into categories based on the type of hook. So pre-commit hooks are located under the PreCommit option, and post-commit hooks are located under PostCommit. See the default configuration for a thorough example.  "
510,5861,"Within a hook category, there is a special type of hook configuration that applies to _all_ hooks in the category. This configuration looks like a normal hook configuration, except it has the name ALL:  @abstr_code_section  The ALL configuration is useful for when you want to @abstr_hyperlink up your configuration, or when you want to apply changes across an entire category of hooks.  Note that array configuration options (like include/exclude) in the special ALL hook section are not merged with individual hook configurations if custom ones are defined for the hook. Any custom configuration option for include/exclude will replace the ALL hook's configuration. If you want to have a global list of default exclusions and extend them with a custom list, you can use YAML references, e.g.  @abstr_code_section  Again, you can consult the default configuration for detailed examples of how the ALL hook can be used.  "
510,5862,"You may want to enforce the version of Overcommit or other gems that you use in your git hooks. This can be done by specifying the gemfile option in your .overcommit.yml.  The gemfile option tells Overcommit to load the specified file with @abstr_hyperlink , the standard gem dependency manager for Ruby. This is useful if you would like to:    * Enforce a specific version of Overcommit to use for all hook runs (or to use a version from the master branch that has not been released yet)   * Enforce a specific version or unreleased branch is used for a gem you want to use in your git hooks    Loading a Bundler context necessarily adds a startup delay to your hook runs as Bundler parses the specified Gemfile and checks that the dependencies are satisfied. Thus for projects with many gems this can introduce a noticeable delay.  The recommended workaround is to create a separate Gemfile in the root of your repository (call it .overcommit_gems.rb), and include only the gems that your Overcommit hooks need in order to run. Generate the associated lock file by running:  @abstr_code_section  ...and commit .overcommit_gems.rb and the resulting .overcommit_gems.rb.lock file to your repository. Set your gemfile option to .overcommit_gems.rb, and you're all set.  Using a smaller Gemfile containing only the gems used by your Overcommit hooks significantly reduces the startup delay in your hook runs. It is thus the recommended approach unless your project has a relatively small number of gems in your Gemfile.  "
510,5863,You can change the directory that project-specific hooks are loaded from via the plugin_directory option. The default directory is .git-hooks.  
510,5864,"If you prefer to have your hooks be completely silent unless there is a problem, you can set the top-level quiet option to true. Note that if you have many hooks or slow hooks this may not be desirable, as you don't get visual feedback indicating the general progress of the hook run.  "
510,5865,"Overcommit runs hooks in parallel by default, with a number of concurrent workers equal to the number of logical cores on your machine. If you know your particular set of hooks would benefit from higher/lower number of workers, you can adjust the global concurrency option. You can define single-operator mathematical expressions, e.g. %{processors} * @abstr_number, or %{processors} / @abstr_number.  @abstr_code_section  Note that individual hooks can specify the number of processors they require with the processors hook option. See the hook options section for more details.  "
510,5866,You can disable manual verification of signatures by setting verify_signatures to false. See the Security section for more information on this option and what exactly it controls.  
510,5867,"Currently, Overcommit supports the following hooks out of the box—simply enable them in your .overcommit.yml.  Note : Hooks with a * are enabled by default.  Warning : This list represents the list of hooks available on the master branch. Please consult the change log to view which hooks have not been released yet.  "
510,5868,"commit-msg hooks are run against every commit message you write before a commit is created. A failed hook prevents a commit from being created.

510,5873,"pre-commit hooks are run after git commit is executed, but before the commit message editor is displayed. If a hook fails, the commit will not be created. These hooks are ideal for syntax checkers, linters, and other checks that you want to run before you allow a commit to even be created.  "
510,5874,"pre-commit hooks currently do not support hooks with side effects (such as modifying files and adding them to the index with git add). This is a consequence of Overcommit's pre-commit hook stashing behavior to ensure hooks are run against _only the changes you are about to commit_.  Without Overcommit, the proper way to write a pre-commit hook would be to extract the staged changes into temporary files and lint those files instead of whatever contents are in your working tree (as you don't want unstaged changes to taint your results). Overcommit takes care of this for you, but to do it in a generalized way introduces this limitation.

510,5877,"Out of the box, overcommit comes with a set of hooks that enforce a variety of styles and lints. However, some hooks only make sense in the context of a specific repository.  For example, you can have a number of simple checks that run against your code to catch common errors. For example, if you use @abstr_hyperlink , you can make sure all spec files contain the line require 'spec_helper'.  Inside our repository, we can add the file .git-hooks/pre_commit/ensure_spec_helper.rb in order to automatically check our spec files:  @abstr_code_section  The corresponding configuration for this hook would look like:  @abstr_code_section  "
510,5878,"You might already have hook scripts written which you'd like to integrate with Overcommit right away. To make this easy, Overcommit allows you to include your hook script in your configuration without writing any Ruby code. For example:  @abstr_code_section  So long as a command is given (either by specifying the command option directly or specifying required_executable) a special hook is created that executes the command and appends any arguments and standard input stream that would have been passed to the regular hook. The hook passes or fails based on the exit status of the command.  The script is executed as if Git were calling the hook directly. If you want to understand which arguments are passed to the script depending on the type of hook, see the @abstr_hyperlink .  "
510,5879,"While Overcommit can make managing Git hooks easier and more convenient, this convenience can come at a cost of being less secure.  Since installing Overcommit hooks will allow arbitrary plugin code in your repository to be executed, you expose yourself to an attack where checking out code from a third party can result in malicious code being executed on your system.  As an example, consider the situation where you have an open source project. An attacker could submit a pull request which adds a post-checkout hook that executes some malicious code. When you fetch and checkout this pull request, the post-checkout hook will be run on your machine, along with the malicious code that you just checked out.  Overcommit attempts to address this problem by storing a signature of your configuration and all hook plugin code since the last time it ran. When the signature changes, a warning is displayed alerting you to which plugins have changed. It is then up to you to manually verify that the changes are not malicious, and then continue running the hooks.  The signature is derived from the contents of the plugin's source code itself and any configuration for the plugin. Thus a change to the plugin's source code or your local repo's .overcommit.yml file could result in a signature change.  "
510,5880,"In typical usage, your plugins usually don't change too often, so this warning shouldn't become a nuisance. However, users who work within proprietary repositories where all developers who can push changes to the repository already have a minimum security clearance may wish to disable this check.  While not recommended, you can disable signature verification by setting verify_signatures to false in your .overcommit.yml file.  Regardless of whether you haveverify_signatures disabled for your project, if you are running Overcommit for the first time you will need to sign your configuration with overcommit --sign. This needs to happen once so Overcommit can record in your local git repo's configuration (outside of source control) that you intend to enable/disable verification. This way if someone else changes verify_signatures you'll be asked to confirm the change.  "

513,5906,"We are happy to announce the complete relaunch of fixer.io into a more stable, more secure, and much more advanced currency & exchange rate conversion API platform. While the core structure of our API remains unchanged, all users of the legacy Fixer API will be required to sign up for a free API access key and perform a few simple changes to their integration. To learn more about the changes that are required, please jump to the „Required Changes“ section below.  Required Changes to Legacy Integrations (api.fixer.io)  As of March @abstr_number th @abstr_number , the legacy Fixer API (api.fixer.io) is deprecated and a completely re-engineered API is now accessible at https://data.fixer.io/api/ The core structure of the old API has remained unchanged, and you will only need to perform a few simple changes to your integration.  _* @abstr_number . Get a Free Fixer Access Token_ *  Go to fixer.io and create an account. After signup, you will receive an access token immediately. If you plan on using less than @abstr_number requests per month, your account will be completely free. If you need more or want to use some of our new features, you’ll need to choose one of the paid options.  _* @abstr_number . Replace API URL and add Access Key_ *  The new API comes with a new endpoint and now requires an access key in the GET URL. Please change your API URL from api.fixer.io to https://data.fixer.io/api and attach your newly generated access key to the URL as a GET parameter named „access_key“.  Example  If your old API Call was https://api.fixer.io/latest then your new integration should point to: https://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY  New Features  Although the core structure of the fixer API remains unchanged, we added a whole lot of improvements, @abstr_number + more currencies, and many more features to the new Fixer API. You can read more about all new features on the new fixer.io website. Here’s a list of the most important ones:    * Fixer is still free! Although we now offer a set of premium plans for more advanced users, the basic API features (e.g. getting the latest and historical exchange rates) remain completely free of charge. Minor limitations include our new @abstr_number requests/month limit and EUR being the only available base currency for customers using a free account. If you need more than @abstr_number requests per month or want to use all @abstr_number available base currencies, you’ll need to choose one of the paid plans starting at only $ @abstr_number per month.    * Over @abstr_number Additional Currencies The new Fixer API now supports over @abstr_number additional currencies, bumping the total available currencies for conversion to @abstr_number .    * More Reliable Data Sources & Updates every minute The old Fixer API was limited to currency data from the European Central Bank, which updates only once every day. The new API comes with @abstr_number + connected data sources and data updates every hour, @abstr_number -minutes, or even every minute - depending on which subscription plan you choose.    * More Endpoints The new fixer API has over @abstr_number new endpoints, including a Direct Conversion endpoint, Time-Series conversion endpoint, and allows you to see the fluctuation of a specfic currency using our new Fluctuation endpoint. To learn more about all the new features, please head over to the API documentation at fixer.io/documentation     Next Steps - Discontinuation of the old API  The old, deprecated Fixer API will be discontinued on _*June @abstr_number st, @abstr_number *_. Please make sure to adjust your existing implementation to point to the new API endpoint (see above) as soon as possible in order to prevent service disruption on the planned shutdown date. In case you have any questions, please feel free to contact us using the email address below.  - Need help? Please get in touch  It’s very important for us to ensure a smooth transition to the new API Endpoint for all of our users.

(With recent enough tokens such as a YubiKey @abstr_number , a similar setup can be achieved by using the verify-required and resident options, after setting a FIDO @abstr_number PIN with YubiKey Manager: the private key file will still be required, but it can be regenerated from the YubiKey.)  "
514,5926,"gpg-agent can act as an ssh-agent, and it can use keys stored on the PGP applet of a YubiKey.  This requires a finicky setup process dealing with PGP keys and the gpg UX, and seems to lose track of the YubiKey and require restarting all the time. Frankly, I've also had enough of PGP and GnuPG.  "
514,5927,"ssh-agent can load PKCS# @abstr_number applets to interact with PIV tokens directly. There are two third-party PKCS# @abstr_number providers for YubiKeys (OpenSC and ykcs @abstr_number ) and one that ships with macOS (man @abstr_number ssh-keychain).  The UX of this solution is poor: it requires calling ssh-add to load the PKCS# @abstr_number module and to unlock it with the PIN (as the agent has no way of requesting input from the client during use, a limitation that yubikey-agent handles with pinentry), and needs manual reloading every time the YubiKey is unplugged or the machine goes to sleep.  The ssh-agent that ships with macOS (which is pretty cool, as it starts on demand and is preconfigured in the environment) also has restrictions on where the .so modules can be loaded from. It can see through symlinks, so a Homebrew-installed /usr/local/lib/libykcs @abstr_number .dylib won't work, while a hard copy at /usr/local/lib/libykcs @abstr_number .copy.dylib will.  /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib works out of the box, but only with RSA keys.

514,5929,"@abstr_hyperlink is part of a suite of tools to work with PIV tokens. It's similar to yubikey-agent, and inspired its design.  The main difference is that it requires unlocking via ssh-add -X rather than using a graphical pinentry, and it caches the PIN in memory rather than relying on the device PIN policy.

520,5951,@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_image  @abstr_image   Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage is a C++ trading system that does automatic long/short arbitrage between Bitcoin exchanges.  
520,5952,"Bitcoin is still a new and inefficient market. Several Bitcoin exchanges exist around the world and the bid/ask prices they propose can be briefly different from an exchange to another. The purpose of Blackbird is to automatically profit from these temporary price differences while being market-neutral.  Here is a real example where an arbitrage opportunity exists between Bitstamp (long) and Bitfinex (short):  @abstr_image  At the first vertical line, the spread between the exchanges is high so Blackbird buys Bitstamp and short sells Bitfinex. Then, when the spread closes (second vertical line), Blackbird exits the market by selling Bitstamp and buying Bitfinex back.  "
520,5953,"Unlike other Bitcoin arbitrage systems, Blackbird doesn't sell but actually _short sells_ Bitcoin on the short exchange. This feature offers two important advantages:  @abstr_number . The strategy is always market-neutral: the Bitcoin market's moves (up or down) don't impact the strategy returns. This removes a huge risk from the strategy. The Bitcoin market could suddenly lose half its value that this won't make any difference in the strategy returns.  @abstr_number . The strategy doesn't need to transfer funds (USD or BTC) between Bitcoin exchanges. The buy/sell and sell/buy trading activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges, independently. Advantage: no need to deal with transfer latency issues.  More details about _short selling_ and _market neutrality_ can be found on @abstr_hyperlink .  "
